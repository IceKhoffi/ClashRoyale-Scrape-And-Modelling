Christian Monserrate,4,2025-10-10 07:47:17,"It's a great game overall, my biggest complaint is how pay to win the game can be, about 75 percent of the items in the shop are bought with money, which makes it so much easier to level up cards instantly. I don't like about paying for mobile games, so I've always been a free to play user. There's been some challenges against pay to win users, but nothing major if you manage to have good level cards"
Aaron Schneider,4,2025-11-04 04:22:35,I've played this game for about 5 months now and I love it. Compared to other phone games you can actually lose games and learn strategies to build better decks and combos. The only negative thing I have to say about it is it's definitely a pay-to-win game. Players in Arena 10 are spawning champions and spamming op cards that can't be unlocked until 6 arenas later
Radu Codreanu,3,2025-10-16 23:49:47,"Honestly I think the game was in a good spot and still is, but for whatever reason they decided to add... merge tactics (of all things) to it, instead of maybe improving on the clan gameplay? And they locked away the ranked mode which was really fun. One step forward, two steps back. The matchmaking feels better overall though for some time now."
Eluen Rodriguez V.,4,2025-08-19 12:54:08,"I really like most of the changes that the game has made over the years, I just wish that it was more f2p friendly, bring back the season shop, but better, making it easier to get the things the shop had to offer, the evo shards, currencies, cards, it would be nice if they added elite wildcards too, but maybe it's too much to ask. But there's a lot of potential in that idea, bringing back the trading tokens or whatever, I think it would make everyone happy."
Preston,4,2025-08-14 09:29:41,"I won't lie, Clash is a great is an amazing game to play. They now have two different gamemodes and they're both pretty fun to play. The only thing I'm not too happy about is the part where they removed the shop, the one that pretty much carried us free to play players in collecting evo's. Now we have to wait for events like this or gotta buy our way through the game."
Timothy Poulos,3,2025-09-25 07:00:28,As a free to play player with 8+ years I've seen this game change and grow. All the good stuff and the bad. It's a better state now then it was a few years ago. Some things are still not balanced but things have been shaping up recently. The competitive nature of the game feels lacking with no incentive to play ranked. As of recently they changed trophyroad and ranked once more linking the two. Hitting 15000 unlocks ranked and resets at the end of the season to 12000 which is a horrible change.
Sky Chan,1,2025-08-08 21:40:12,After almost 7 years of playing and staying positive. The newest update just spells Pay to Win. For the past few years I always enjoyed Party mode over climbing a ladder with an unbalanced algorithm. Party mode was the only way I earn gold coins to level up to 14. You have taken that away to replace with Pay to Win Party mode. The max amount daily is capped at 1000 which is accomplished in a few rounds. You need to pay to collect double amount with a time limit. Who ask for this update?
Luke Washington,2,2025-07-22 02:01:36,This is one of the best mobile games ever made. No ads. Vertical Gameplay. You can succeed without spending money (for the most part) and most importantly the community aspect of it. but I fear that supercells inability to keep 2v2s in the game makes this app a dumpster fire. I cant enjoy playing w my friends and im forced to face 1v1s against high level players w level 14 cards for some reason. It makes 0 sense why they wouldnt just keep 2v2s in the game. Its so confusing it angers me.
Russell Robinson,3,2025-07-19 20:36:44,"I have been playing this game off and on since 2018, and I wish I could go back to those days. Clan wars is worse, the games have never felt more pay to win than before. I am at level 14 8500+ trophies and I enjoy playing but it is so hard playing against evolutions and level 15s when I am simply miles away from them. Worst part is it takes 3 SEASONS to get the evolution you want for a f2p. Making retro bowl a permanent game would eliminate my critique, until then fun game but p2w near the top."
Aditya Goel,3,2025-04-20 03:02:42,"Money sucker! The game is fantastic. It's highly addictive once you get the feel of it. One thing which I found annoying is when you are in battle mode and you get matched against an opponent of higher your level. It's very difficult to beat them since the health of their cards is much more. Ergo, I wish if we get matched according to king tower levels in battle instead of number of trophies. That would be a level playing field. also, gameplay sucks on mobile internet. I hope creators fix it."
JD,2,2025-05-29 11:52:55,"This was one of my favorite games. However, the recent update (early 2025) has reduced the how much gold you can get by so much, you can't hardly advance. Gold chests that were worth 25k - 30k now only seem to give about 4 or 5k, and several other reductions. I've bought the monthly royale pass thing for quite a while. I won't buy it anymore and will likely quit playing all together. Hopefully they'll change it back!!"
Marcelo Matos,1,2025-07-24 19:44:25,"Three words define the actual state of the game: unrewarding, frustrating and repetitive. Right now, Clash Royale has become the most frustrating and repetitive game of all. I'm quitting the game for good because I'm sick of going against the same annoying decks over and over again. there is a lack of balance and the recent updates and new cards really sucks. The only almost fun thing about the game was the 2x2 battles, but the devs get rid of it."
D3r_Daniel,1,2025-07-13 20:57:36,"Within two updates they removed both the 2v2 and the ranked mode, giving you no more option for a fair and balanced matchmaking. This makes the game unplayable if you don't put in enough money to level your troops up to what is typical for your ladder points. Every match is either a clear win or loss right from the start, since it solely depends on what levels yours and the opponent's cards have."
TheSane Insane,1,2025-07-24 10:31:22,"I have played this game on and off for around 8 years. Before the game was pretty fun with lots of strategy and creative thinking needed to win. Now it's just pay to win, if you don't have max level cards you are bound to lose no matter how much skill you have. Match making is even worse with having to constantly go against the same meta decks such as logbait, but they decide the best course of action to reduce log usage and logbait is to nerf log which just makes it a much worse problem."
Kai Svitek,2,2025-01-26 20:09:58,"Would be fun, which it is, if it wasn't horrible at finding wifi. Can't even go five seconds without disconnecting. Once I was in a battle and my enemy was winning and I could've defended it if this sad excuse of a game didn't boot me out. I have full bars on wifi and internet but then I go into the game and then I have like 1 bar or just none. It gets so bad that in fact, it works BETTER outside in the car... FIX YOUR STUPID GAMES, this also happens on CoC too."
Eats Winner,2,2024-12-26 15:24:19,"I’ve played Clash Royale off and on for over 8 years and it was incredible at launch with fresh cards, exciting game modes and constant updates. However recent years have been disappointing with fewer content updates and an increased focus on pay-to-win microtransactions. It feels like the game is now geared toward those willing to spend money which ruins the balance and fun for long time players. It’s sad to see such an amazing game come to this but it still has potential if it listens to us."
No Name,1,2024-09-16 02:19:45,"It's an alright game, but with each update it gets worse. They release Evo's for cards that don't need it like the Mega Knight and Pekka which genuinely takes away from the experience. At first it was just a little annoying but now it's gotten to a point that you can't play casual 2v2 or 1v1 without running into an evo pekka, evo mega knight, with a sparky placed behind it or what have you. I guess it's just a bit annoying to see Supercell encourage a playstyle that makes the game boring"
Vaughn Cross,1,2025-04-25 06:08:29,"worse and worse with time, over the past 9 years of playing this game all the time, I can safely say supercell lost the plot. what an amazing concept ruined by removal of content and focus on profit. it'll be sad to see the complete loss of support for one of my favorite games of all time. ups and downs, 4/19/25 update was the worst down we've seen."
Lucian,4,2024-12-27 05:39:07,"This is a really great game, very fun, but it can sometimes be frustrating losing the battles, especially if you're really close to the next arena and lose your trophies."
Jacob Budd-Rivers,4,2025-11-03 18:59:16,"So ridiculously pay to win now, so if you don't have the game and are thinking of getting it, either get it NOW before it becomes even worse, or don't get it at all. I got in back during Little Prince times, before the game was this bad. My experience with the game is alright, it's a fun game to come back to here and there. Miss the season shop but I've come to accept that's gone. Really a solid game just prices are bad"
Adrian - Nicolae Fleser,1,2025-11-03 22:51:04,"Since the November 2025 update I am unable to play the game. The game constantly crashes when I try to join a battle and suddenly closes, but the battle starts in the background cuz I am losing points. I cleared the data and also cleared the cache, then restarted the device and then tried to play the game again, still not working, still crashing when I try to start any battle. Also tried to delete the game and reinstall it, still crashing. Please fix the game!"
EL,1,2025-10-25 18:13:01,"The matchmaking is unbalanced. I’ve already tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game, but the connection keeps dropping randomly. After the latest update, the game gets stuck at 75% loading and never reaches 100%. I’ve cleared the cache and force-closed the app, but the issue still happens. Meanwhile, my internet connection is very stable and fast when using other apps."
Pavol Bolecek,1,2025-08-24 03:45:30,"The concept of the game is fun, yes, the execution is terrible. What used to be a fun game has, in the past few years, turned into a terrible pay to win game. Supercell, being the greedy company they are, of course make it so that if you're a free to play player, the progression takes years, and after a certain point is just plainly impossible without the need to spend money. They're removing free ways to progress, and making it so you have to pay. And they don't nerf OP pay to win cards."
Christian James,1,2025-10-10 10:28:29,"For those of you who are experiencing difficulties logging on, like the app crashes everytime you load it up this is for you. First, delete the app and re-download it. When the app is finished downloading, go into storage, find the app, and clear all cache and all data. Then I should be working fine. Hopefully this helps :) I found out about it recently I've been wondering how I cant log on."
Rossi Busquets,1,2025-09-19 20:29:41,"Unfortunately, the game is not what it used to be. Still kinda playable, but the performance lacks, a lot, constantly having internet problems in glimpses which made me lose a couple of won matches. Also is quite laggy sometimes usually when opening chests or loading the screen. Edit:The game is preventing me to play now, it's terrible. On clan wars it says I should create a war deck before, which I did, not even changed it. But it keeps showing the same error, and now on casual without warning."
محمد ترکی,1,2025-10-14 02:54:59,This game is full of small and big bugs. Game bugs: Sometimes your net is great but the game has bugs and your internet is weak. The reason you lose is the game's fault. The game used to be very good but now your skill is not visible and the reason you win is because of the cards you choose. The game is full of robots that are extremely strong. Very expensive offers and... I can't say more.
Ilias Filip,1,2025-10-03 06:27:47,"The game just screams pay-to-win. I recently started playing, and I've encountered countless PTW guys. It's ridiculous. Do you expect people to play a game where it doesn't take skill but money to advance? I have screenshots of games where I (9) have to battle against level 10 (ok I guess), 11, 12, or even 13! Which also brings us to matchmaking, which is also problematic. Same levels, not trophies, should determine who you play with. The game has many smaller issues as well..."
Kulranjan Tirkey,1,2025-08-17 18:26:01,"The network problem has been there for ages. And not fixed till now. I just returned to this game again, but the network drop is costing me trophies and it drops at a time when it's crucial to drop a troop but the network doesn't allow me to and keeps buffering. I'm very dissatisfied with the game. And Oh! ya game disconnects frequently. Even during the matches. LoL."
Nico,4,2025-10-30 03:51:15,"Really addicting game, it can be pretty frustrating playing against pay to win players but for the most part if you're skilled enough you can climb the ranks rather quickly. Too many people complain about P2W when they just suck at the game, everyone can get to 10k trophies without paying a penny if they actually try for a bit so I wouldn't say it's enough to make me dislike the game. The mechanics are overall very nice and the balancing is decent imo (except for most newly released cards)"
ufuk baycan,1,2025-10-19 16:16:07,"Somethings are very fishy here.. everytime right before I'm about to pass to next arena, all my opponents suddenly have that ""thing"" that I don't have, it could be evolutions, legendary heroes, or 15 level cards. And somehow those things that I can't beat is being sold at the shop for real money... hmmm... peculiar.."
Shaun Tshegofatšo,1,2025-10-26 21:57:32,"I used to enjoy this game but I no longer do, the game is way to pay to win now. I got to Arena 15 and started losing a lot of games due to other player's troops being higher level than mine. The game also seems to not want to unlock cards, I think about 10 weren't found. it limits how you play. I'm deleting this game and I won't look back."
Frank Walters,1,2025-10-19 05:00:25,"this is a very good, fun, and entertaining game and very competitive overall the gameplay is incredible but unfortunately this rating is low for a reason, this game is extremely pay to win to the point where if you spend enough money is is very difficult to near impossible to beat and overleveled player not even to mention the evolutions whic I think we're a great addition to the game but I unfortunately locked behind a paywall to even unlock them I want to rate this game higher but I just can't"
Adnan Pipić,1,2025-10-22 15:52:12,Too much gap when it comes to playing against people that buy cards. I understand you need to make money but this is just to much seeing lvl 15 card on a tower 12 player. And from what I noticed its 2/3 of players that are in my lobby. Maybe you sould think about filtering out regular and premium members so it can be a fair match. From what I see right now it's just not a strategy game anymore its just a pay to win game unless you are in higher arenas where you have to an extent maxed out card .
Charlie,1,2025-10-28 02:26:05,"This is a game with fun and original mechanics. The reason I rate it one star is due to its macabre amount of psychological manipulation. The game is made to be unfair; every once in a while, matchmaking places you against people with higher levels. You can still win these matches, but it's obviously harder because you unfairly start from a disadvantage. They do this so that you end up losing, get mad, and pay por the expensive upgrades that the game offers via its Battle Pass and shop ""offers""."
Dustin Ashley,1,2025-10-24 09:08:52,"They ruined the game. It used to be worth grinding. Now it's a complete joke and you literally will never max out your account without spending thousands of dollars. Shame. They also introduced AI bots (even at the highest level of trophies, currently 15k) to facilitate their dark-pattern biased algorithm designed to make sure your win rate stays around 50%. This game is truly not worth anyone's time anymore. Unless you enjoy paying $15 a month to unlock pay-walled power-crept mechanics. Huge L"
Avi Fecher,4,2025-10-28 02:02:29,"Clash royale is a great game that involves strategy and lots of fun.However there are some frustrating things about it, it is really easy to come across a p2w player because they are usually extremely over levelled and can win without any skill whatsoever.Despite this once you get to the much higher arenas most people will already have high level cards and the game will gradually become much much harder. In conclusion it is a very fun and enjoyable game although it does have some weaknesses."
C red,3,2025-11-02 14:58:58,"Great game, just pay to win issues. although, with patience you can play enough to win Its just a lot of time. Im currently 9500 trophies which isn't crazy good, but enough to have been around the block a few times. Only issues is this and eventually you start battling the same old decks. Because people just start looking up whats working or other alternatives. With the main one just being a hog rider & firecracker. The firecracker card is the definition of broken. It just takes away some fun."
Yaher,1,2025-10-21 09:42:07,The game is very unplayable now. The game was so strategy based back in the day and now it's like every time I play it I'm forced to spend at least $10 to enjoy this game. Also AI shouldn't get infinite elixir. Every game I queue into an AI cycles a giant and wizard every goblin card in the game. I mean are you guys even restricting these robots to 8 card decks? Also the game isn't even fair anymore. Prince in a starters arena? Evolution firecracker to. You've definitely lost 1 player for good.
Steven Smith,1,2025-10-31 14:31:54,"I tried to return after a long absence from playing. I don't see any option to sign into my Google account that my profile is linked to... I don't understand why they would remove this basic feature or why I'm unable to recover my account. I don't have a Supercell account, but I logged into my Clash of Clans account without any issues. This one just appears to be gone."
Demetrius D'souza,1,2025-10-30 17:36:51,Even after many years the devs have still not fixed the matchmaking in Clan Wars. It really is not fun going against players who have cards that are 5 levels above me. Complete Pay to win gameplay. I cannot understand why the card and tower levels cannot be capped at lvl 11 to make the gameplay more fair. Making the matchmaking based on win rate is a sure fire way to make it unfair for low level players
Ty Taylor,1,2025-10-25 15:47:03,"This game has turned into such a money grab. It used to be good when levels were capped at way lower numbers, but now people can just spend money instantly win. The way the arena's are, it's impossible to change your deck because without spending money you're just going to lose. I wish SuperCell would make it even possible to win by skill and not money. I also don't understand what their plan was with merge tactics, and it just seems like another way to spend money on this game"
Kaleb Hise,1,2025-10-19 21:52:32,I will be honest the game is fun when you are in lower arenas but after you hit 5k trophies thats where it ends. There's no fun in it anymore. The game gets so toxic I just want to play the game and not deal with some skill less push. The only thing in this game you need is the credit card because it is so heavily pay to win. This game sucks so don't play it. it is not worth the time and money you need to spend just to hit a certain arena.
Lance Pitts,1,2025-10-30 12:31:57,terrible game which is really sad because it used to be amazing. this game used to actually take skill but is now just a cash grab. if you don't spend money on the season pass you can't play the brand new broken evos for months. being free to play is extremely hard to get a full deck to level 15 so I'm stuck with level 14 cards which leads to really horrible interactions for me. level 15 and evos were the worst things ever added to this game which is such a shame. i can no longer be competitive
Jordan Rose (JZR),1,2025-10-22 07:25:41,"this game was so fun like a year ago but it was sorta repetitive so I left it for a bit, I log back in and the game is so pay to win its not even funny. the new evolution mechanic is basically unavailable for people won't don't wanna waste money for a game like this and as such the overpowered characters lead to the people willing to spend 100s of dollars to this have such an advantage it's so unfair."
James Linville,1,2025-10-23 03:31:19,"9 year veteran with this game and I've never seen such a huge flip flop from a balanced game turn to pay to win. Its borderline cynical the way the game manipulates you. The grind to level 15 takes a level of dedication you'd put into a full time job. Or spend $1000 just to be at an even playing field. They introduce new evo cards that break the game every few weeks and bundles in the shop more than they balance the game by an exponential amount. Save your dignity, time, and money, just dont."
Mm M,1,2025-11-03 07:52:31,"fun for a little bit but let's get to the higher levels it leaves you in a lockdown, you can't level up everybody you fights is at a higher level than you it has characters you haven't even unlocked yet and that kills the game you'll beat a couple you'll move a little bit forward and the Quest level but then be given people that are more powerful not getting it back down three or four quest levels can you repeat this process over and over even if you play with the best character you have unlocke"
Brennan Corey,1,2025-10-31 11:57:47,"The game is overall horrible. Matchmaking and balance is off by a ton! I began the game a week after release and it was fun with all the creative strategies and minimal cards with random decks, but throughout the years the game has added more cards and updates players like me think that began the downfall. Needless to say the game is absolutely horrible and the developers need to add back old game modes including 2v2's."
Will Coats,1,2025-10-26 23:29:20,"Been playing for over 3 Years. Initially this is a good real-time strategy game but getting high level without spending real money takes many years mathematically (not making this up, it's been calculated, Im not maxed myself). Supercell has turned into greedy devs recently and have progressively ruined the game."
Kaylee Parsuram,4,2025-11-03 18:02:36,"I like the game, been playing it for 2 years now. however the event side is still under construction, and I miss the days where you had to wait for a chest to open. because its really easy to level up, making it not that special to be on a high level"
Lucas Styles,1,2025-10-27 04:21:34,"I would not recommend playing this game. Something about the match making is off. When I change my deck my opponents decks change to counter it. On top of that, it purposely pins you up against people so it can demote your trophies more. It feels like I am made to win a couple, then lose it all so I keep playing. I keep on having 5 wins in a row followed by 11 losses. It's not worth your time to get addicted to this game."
Mohana priyan,2,2025-11-02 22:41:24,I have been playing since it came... game is excellent but updates having bug issues... I have contacted them via mail and told all my issues with photos and video. still no response yet . bug issues which I am seeing are No 1 : after completing each game it get stucked at 96% to play next game i have to close and reopen it No 2 : when I tend to open this game it's get closed automatically.. not once more than thrice it's getting closed
Petar,1,2025-10-29 05:18:55,"One of the biggest gaps when it comes to pay2win and free2play players, not only between the players themselves who pay to win but the game itself gives you nothing if u are a free player and you can't even progress so not much of a point in playing anymore of ur not willing to pay... bring back the old clash."
Kimberly Clifford,1,2025-11-03 16:20:31,"This game was great years ago. But now, Supercell keeps CHANGING the game WAY too much & ruins ur progress. I understand that they want to keep the game new and exciting, but every damn week or 2, they COMPLETELY change the ""stats"" of the cards. Its so bad now, that i COMPLETELY REFUSE to spend ANY MONEY on this game, whatsoever. On one day, you could invest all your coins & resources into beefing up a card, and the next day, THEY COMPLETELY CHANGE HOW the card even works! Very sad."
Vince Barnes,1,2025-11-04 13:14:51,"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! The game is designed to only help those who pay. If you don't pay you can lose up to 30 games in a row. Wow I've come back to this game, paid for a few things and progressed well I stopped paying and I lose all the time. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP PLAYING THIS GAME WHICH IS MADE FOR THE RICH."
Sebastian H.,1,2025-10-29 16:34:30,"Used to have a good review but supercell, the players and general gameplay have gotten absolutely horrendous. It's not competitive anymore, you just pay 50$ (or more 💀) for the new broken thing they add each update and if you don't, you lose. For your own good, just don't. -- DO NOT RECOMMEND --"
Christopher Vanegas,2,2025-10-31 22:16:47,"Honestly speaking, it's a great game, BUT it's pay to win like crazy. It's also super annoying that when I don't buy the battle pass, I will go against every counter to any single deck I use, it also takes slightly longer to find a match, like they are hand picking my opponent. YET the minute I buy the stupid pass, I fly up the ranks like nothing, I somehow all of a sudden don't get a single counter deck until I get to the higher ranks again. It's just hilarious to me."
Reza Ghadirian,1,2025-11-04 07:23:47,"After the latest update, the game has become completely unplayable for me. It consistently crashes and kicks me out during the arena loading screen, right before a battle starts. I've tried everything on my end, including uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but the problem persists. This leads me to a serious concern: is this happening because of a new regional block for players in Iran or those using a VPN? If so, after supporting this game for over 9 years, this is an incredibly unfair way"
Levi Keating,1,2025-11-01 05:37:20,Was playing the game for about 2 months. Stopped playing for about a month. Trying to get back on the game? I go to my supper cell id to log back in 10 or 15 times he's sending me codes. I type it in and it said it's the wrong code over and over over again. Figure it out super sell your multibillion dollar company
A Google user,1,2025-10-19 17:13:06,"This game used to be my favourite years ago. It saddens me to see the changes for the worst being made. No chests like before, worst characters and no 2v2 mode. The constant sudden pop ups, sounds amd colors to make it more addicting, make the game more stressful. The game is being changed to appeal to the new generation and getting ruined."
Gábor Danku,1,2025-10-17 19:09:10,"I really try to like this game each time i play it, but it's really hard with the problems it has. First of all, the servers are really bad. If you dont have max network connection, it lags, doesnt place the card you use, and even disconnects you. Secondly, it's always been a pay to win game, and Supercell endorses it eith the updates. Honestly, they had a full season with evos to buff the 2.6 hog cycle. Last of all, the matchmaking is doodoo. You either go against god tier players or bots."
Ali Rafael Castillo Pérez,1,2025-10-19 21:36:47,"Clash Royale was my favorite strategic game, easy to understand and fun, unfortunately if you want to level up you need to pay which makes it a pay to win game. it's incredibly hard to reach higher trophies because your opponents have double evolutions, higher king tower, higher card levels and sometimes the new evolution that you need to buy from the store. I'm at 13,500 trophies, level 14, only one Evo and 3 cards level 15. Solution? Making things more accessible (gold, evos, elite cards...)"
Daniel,1,2025-10-20 10:36:19,"A game once hailed as the pinnacle of 1v1 strategy games, with other gamemodes that introduced more fun ways to enjoy the game, now reduced to something equivalent to having been created by EA. There is now absolutely minimal strategy required; all that's needed is your wallet and credit card and you can enjoy trampling on players. Additional gamemodes have been overhauled, especially draft mode, creating snowballing and steamrolling situations. The P2W pass is not worth it. Go play COC instead."
Aaron Cruz,2,2025-10-17 11:16:40,"Please save yourself your time and don't download this game. I've spent money on this game and have played for about 5+ years now and I can't really quit now. This game has fallen from what it used to be with monetization. In the shop, you get personalized offers which vary in price that give your progession that you wouldn't be able to get otherwise."
Araysh阿雷什,1,2025-10-16 00:54:42,"This is by far the most P2W game I have ever seen in my life. The difference in cards level makes it nearly impossible to kill the opponents cards, mid ladder is impossible to progress through without spending real cash on upgrading your cards and the competitive side of the game only starts after reaching 10k, at that point everyone has the same lvl so it's fair I guess."
Soumyadeep Das,1,2025-08-19 13:13:28,"I don't know whether this was intentional or not, but supercell seems to want to kill this game. 2v2 has been gone for a long time and a number of bugs/glitches have cropped up. There is little to no effort to fix this, as in subsequent updates, supercell seems to only focus on introducing new evolutions to make more and more money. Don't forget that the creator community cannot run this game unless there are players who actually play consistently, who you seem so eager to drive away."
Wolf Rule,2,2025-10-18 12:26:02,very unbalanced comps. and something weird is going on where they release new content ask 14 euros for it and then change that content to something else 🤔 isn't that fraud eu should look into that more big tech is making free money. they could do that for every character in the game times 14 euros. also the game after 8000 trophies becomes stagnant same you will be facing the same deck until 10000 and even after that it's going to be the same.
Sick Gamer,1,2025-10-25 14:08:19,"after 9-10 years, I didn't play it religiously, but...I tried to enjoy it, at the beginning..yes, it was a great game, with great cards. since the evolution cards came up, it's all a pay to get it faster, pay this, pay that, they don't care about balance anymore, mega knight evolution has been broken for so long now, witch evolution as well, simply they seem to introduce evolutions left and right, nothing feels special anymore. gg SUPERCELL, I'm out."
Emily Vang,1,2025-10-16 06:25:12,"I genuinely cannot fathom how pay to win this game is. One sided game. Words cannot describe how much money you have to put in to win games. One out of five stars is too much as a review. Doesn't even deserve 0. Graphics and mechanics are alright, but it's just p2w. Last clan voyage we got 3000 trophies just for princess cards, and I get literally about 1000 gold from a 4 star chest. It's useless, and there is literally nothing to do except get trophies and win battles against level 15 mk cycle."
Lakshay Gupta,1,2025-08-26 02:14:08,Played this game for 7 years now and they have made this into a pay to play mess . The progression system was actually really good until a little while ago but the developers just took out the core progression mechanic with no viable alternative . You actually can't even play because of this change if you have a new account even though it has been several months since the update and the game makes 30 million dollars plus every month
Kalynn Mulvaney,2,2025-10-16 14:21:06,sad to see another game franchise that once provided a fun free to play game with lots of content fall to corp greed. now if you want to get anywhere in CASH royal you've got to pay to play. I was never some elite player who won round to round but now it's become impossible to advance without dropping money. I've played for 9 years and have the badge to prove it. Do better. it's what veteran players want. not what this game's become.
Noah Bracken,2,2025-10-30 20:56:17,"fun game but there is so much BS from supercell it gets annoying. firstly the math on how you get trophies from 10k to 15k is wack. you could face someone with 10-15 more trophies than you and still get the standard 150, but you face someone with 5 less than you and you get 145. this matters because it'll put you at 5 away from the next arena, making you win another match to go up. my other big issue is the amount of in app purchases. why are there 12 of them in the shop before the normal offers"
Griffin ODonnell,1,2025-10-19 15:38:19,"Honestly used to be really funny, but they screwed a lot of the cards over and now it's just pay money for the pass royale to win edit: this is after trying to get back into it. I was wrong for attempting. new season comes out, and everyone will buy the new card and level 15 it. The scope creep in this game is awful and makes it so any old card is just useless. I believe this to be the worst game I've ever had to play"
Vik Vikt,1,2025-09-01 01:40:45,"It's a beautiful game concept with a execution so poor there's more 1 star reviews than 4 star ones. What used to be strategic and creative became a contest of who wasted more money on the game. Evolution slot unlock? £20. An actual Evolution? £7. It's gotten to the point where the ladder climb is 7 times more difficult than 3 or 2 years ago. Almost every aspect of the game that required skill has been pulverised and made pay to win. This is of course, supercell being supercell."
Yuejun Li (Norman),1,2025-11-04 11:47:36,"Such a painful exp when you try to claim rewards. You need to basically click the claim reward, scroll all the way to the bottom of the ladder, click the reward, click 4 time to spin the chest, wait for it to finish spinning a few seconds before opening. All that is for one chest. Want to claim all the alluring rewards? repeat the whole damn thing over and over again! Such a horrible and painful experience. Do the developers play the game themselves?"
IP,1,2025-10-20 04:15:35,"Pathetic after new updates. I'm playing for past 7 years, and the matching algorithm is pathetic. How come a player without evolution cards match with players who use evolution cards? It's either you're making people pay and purchase or you don't want them to play fair. It's horrible to see such updates. Now I'm feeling like it's better to uninstall this app. If you go beyond trophy levels 9k you're only getting matched with evo card players where they take advantage and it's easy fr them to win"
Nate,1,2025-09-01 22:00:13,"It was a great game but each day it seems the game is getting more and more pay to win. They keep adding more and more ways to level up your cards and get evos through micro transactions, but they slowly take away all of the free aspects of the game. For example they took away chests, the seasonal shop and you only get 2 Evo shards from the free side of the clash pass. It also seems that they are taking advantage of their streamers and ignoring what the players want."
Krista Loechner,5,2025-10-26 01:48:17,"I installed the app because my 15 year old son plays it. I thought I'd play it for a bit with him over the weekend, have a common interest to talk about. I am still playing the game 2 months later and, trust me, that's saying a lot for the game. I get bored easily. This game is a lot of fun. I buy the monthly pass because Supercell makes the purchase worth it. This month, the pass gave me all 6 shards to unlock the Evo Skeleton Army, and that's just one reward of 100+. Definitely recommend. 😜"
Aditya Sharma,1,2025-09-21 15:34:29,"In one word: pay-to-win. As a free-to-play player, I've noticed that earning opportunities are dwindling. Level 15 is designed to squeeze extra cash, and rewards from chests, shops, weekly deals, and events are becoming less valuable over time. New cards are overpowered, prompting players to spend heavily, only to be nerfed in future updates – a clever money-making tactic by Supercell."
Kriper Svinjica,1,2025-11-01 02:52:29,"Absolutely trash game, maybe the worst mobile game ever, its so pay to win. to supercell: never make a game again you're just ruining the gaming community. To the people maybe going to install this, don't. Just don't. It's a waste of time and a waste of money. Please delete this game. Also, the matchmaking is terrible. I was queuing up and matched up against a level 15 player. Fix your matchmaking supercell, fix your game."
Jackson Rogers,5,2025-11-02 03:10:10,"First, this game is one of the best games I have ever played, would recommend completely. Alright, the only issue I see is the loading in the game it usually stops at 75% and does not go up higher, but a lot of the time I am in the middle of a match and I have a big advantage over my enemy and the game crashes when I have really fast internet and makes me lose the match. A lot of people say this game is pay to win but it really isnt, but sometimes you vrs p2w players but the system isnt perfect."
Gerrard Proosten,1,2025-10-16 13:13:01,Its a great game but its near impossible to get an email for returning players to obtain their old account back . No matter how many times I try to set my phone up in game with saying yes to using my level 10 king then next page sending a confirmation email to my email address for a super cell ID - I never receive an email or if I do its like several days after I tried getting one and the code becomes invalid. Please fix this !!!!!!!!!!!! I do not want to start again
Presley Ashby,1,2025-11-04 02:30:35,"I will never spend another penny on this game until the obvious cheating and rigged matches are fixed. Besides, the Diamond Pass is WAY over priced. Also, when you lose, you lose pretty much all the trophies that you get from a win. That in and of itself is the most discouraging and demoralizing thing about the game. Then there's the fact that when you drop your units they can be destroyed before their little timer even finishes counting down. Yawn, eye roll and ""nope""= you cheated/rigged match."
Anthony Morales,1,2025-10-30 03:54:22,"this game ducking sucks now, I can't get a single match as a new player without having to come across pay to win players. This game used to be soo good back then, but now all they want is your money. The game is so bad now because you can't even enjoy playing without having to come across 3-10 players who spent hundreds of dollars to get everything. Would not recommend playing until it dies out...."
Luis mateo Salinas Miranda,5,2025-11-02 08:18:49,"Game... Don't play it. Once you reach a certain level, you're hooked and can't quit. You uninstall it, but you'll come back and reinstall it. Never play it again; it's a guaranteed death sentence, This is the only thing standing between getting good grades, having a good education, having a stable family and job, and being able to save for and enjoy vacations; it's the only thing that gets in the way Between a good life and me, but I can't let it . This is serious, don't play around."
SabreTooth,3,2025-11-04 14:38:35,"Updated review. from 1 to 3 stars. came back after 3 years. seems to be a lot better. even added an auto chess game mode - LOVE it, love me some auto chess. but for the love of christ, remove the modifiers that give dummies with random traits. they are just aweful inside of this mode. other than that. game is a lot better and for me at least is now playable and competive. just hate these stupid dummy traits in merge tactics. this is all. have a wonderful day."
Valentin Loyola,5,2025-10-22 21:20:40,"This is the best game I have ever played in all of my life. Clash royale has changed my life for the better, it has introduced me into a new type of gaming and it has shown me what a real game is like. I love how balanced all the cards are and how every match you get to expereince true sportmanship from your opponents. Unlike other games, clash royale is a very free to play game in which money will not give you an advantage over others. Best game I have ever played and I would recomend it."
Ibrahim Nadir Bux,2,2025-10-27 00:12:43,After maintenance the game being played with a strong network connection actually freezes on multiple occasions and lost of trophies overall game is actually good but I would love to give it a 5 star but actually with a few bugs like playing the game with a strong network connection is just freezes that's not on wonder who will take accountability for the loses of trophies when players work hard to get up to reach their goals and how will you'll resolve the issue!!!!!
Harvey K,1,2025-11-02 06:53:55,"Well then. Time for my 2 cents. The people are correct; this game is heavily P2W. The issue is the matchmaking. My friends and I decided to run through the code. Oftentimes, the game scans your deck and finds the best counter deck to heavily reduce your chances of winning. So, if you REALLY wanted to you could make a stand."
Jorge Morales,1,2025-10-29 16:20:23,"I feel like this game just went from a skill level base of gameplay to a pay to win gameplay. Im on arena 21 and from here I feel like it's obligatory to spend money to get to the next arena, I just go against non stop level 15 players while I only have 2 cards at level 14, and even if I tried to switch decks it's only worse since they are even lower level, I don't know if the problem is skill issue or it's just genuinely bc I need to spend on microtransactions."
Viktor Jankuloski,1,2025-10-22 21:32:16,"clash royale is a money grab, after a win I get paired up with someone twice the level that my cards are. I try gaining trophies and getting to higher arenas but it's impossible. Because of this the game has become so infuriating and irritating. I have no intention on playing anymore"
TheBlueMokeOnVR GTAG,4,2025-10-20 02:25:43,Clash is a VERY fun game. But one thing is not being too confusing with all these other things going on. I'm a new player and this game is really fun. It is just the lack of f2p features and how the games setup is kind of confusing
Bhuvan Kapatia,1,2025-10-26 21:27:30,"one of the worst things I find about this game is how it is just centered around if u pay them money u win if u don't u will have the WORST experience ever , I mean sure the gameplay is good but they don't do anything for the free to play players and progress in this game takes super long if u don't buy the shop deals and the community has become so toxic and they encourage this behaviour because every evolution is available in the shop but me, a player Playing for 2+ years has just gotten 3"
L Galliano,1,2025-09-16 03:07:14,"Easily the most pay to win game I've ever played. You can win every battle you play for you just pay instead of actually being good. Not only is it crazily pay 2 win, but being free to play is impossible. I'm a free to play player myself, and I can tell you that it is almost impossible to compete with people who pay. After they added level 15 and evolutions, it became even worse. It takes years of constant playing to get 1 or 2 decks to level 15 as a f2p player, and getting an Evo takes 6 months"
Carmelo Ildefonso,5,2025-11-04 12:03:58,"No matter how many times I take a hiatus, I just keep coming back to this game. It's one of the only games on Android that, as truly advertised, has no ads and great gameplay, just straight up chesslike PvP tower defense goodness. Too much fun for its own good."
Corey A,1,2025-10-21 06:20:33,at first I thought the game was fun and actually a Pvp game but I now realize it isn't at all. I first noticed how my meter was moving as slow as molasses while the other player was pumping out so fast and I mean heavy hitters not just a bunch of 1 or 2s. then the one game I played took all the doubt away. I was playing a game and we all have a max of 10 and in less than 10 sec they came with a mega knight (6) bats (2) a second mega knight (6) and a sparky (6) mathematically impossible.
Simon Ross,1,2025-10-20 11:02:31,"One of the sweatiest communities in all of the games I've played. The game is extremely pay to play. Plenty of characters and the gameplay is good but the sweats that have no life outside of this game, pay to win players that have everything maxed out so even a skeleton one taps, and toxic players that spam emotes they paid way too much for make it near unplayable."
Kyle Baker,2,2025-10-28 20:12:40,"can I please play against other decks? every single time I play its the same exact deck that's build to counter mine. it is so annoying and mundane that regardless of how much I try to enjoy the game, I simply can't. please allow random decks to be matched up. there's certain cards that I've never played against with over 7 years of playing. step it up and stop making it pay to play"
Caleb Kanagy,5,2025-10-28 09:57:52,"Amazing game for the first 7000 trophies. Once you get to there it turns into an endless grind of rage and pain and suffering until you finally reach 10,000. Then more pain and loss of brain cells to get to fifteen k. Once your there you get suckied into a infinite swirl of never ending grinding to keep you rank up every season. Aside from the murderous rage, endless pain, and constant crashouts its a great game."
Eric Hamill,1,2025-10-20 02:49:43,"I only wish I could give it zero stars, the developers should be ashamed of themselves. You need to pay to win. Good luck getting ANYWHERE in this game without putting money into this cash grab. They have absolutely ran this game into the ground forcing you to pay for cards to get any upgrades done. It's truly ridiculous don't even waste your time. (edit. this game is still trash. still matches you with over leveled players still pay to win) straight dumpster fire over here. not even playable"
Marcus Rosu,1,2025-10-25 15:40:59,"the shittiest game i have ever played. I've been stuck in arena 7 for the past week of playing every day a few hours, tried all decks, just because people buy evos which you can't beat at this level. how should i beat a level 10 evo mega knight at arena 7!!?? the most pay to win game i ever played. do not reccomend, stay away if you don't want to spend money to win. 0 stars"
Daniel Kotek,2,2025-10-21 12:41:11,"Very sad to see how frustrating and P2W the game has become. There are clearly skins that give you competitive edge, like skills or more elixir generated, because I have seen players against me dish out 17 elixir under 4 seconds during 1x generation period. Can't defend against that. Otherwise the game did become more diverse, but it's incredibly lacking in it's depth-of-features. Clash of Clans is a much more well maintained game than this. Truly sad to see what this has become."
Arunava Dutta,1,2025-10-26 14:27:00,"Even after the update, Merge Tactics remains as bad as ever. My one complaint about the game was how they likely pre-decide the winner and the rest of the players simply do not get the relevant characters for an upgrade. The new update did not seem to change my perception at all. I mean, at least provide a level playing field and see how the players fare. If only a few players keep getting upgrades, the wins aren't that satisfactory for them too, lol."
Afif Danial (Danny),4,2025-10-23 22:37:27,"Been playing for years already , a lot of things changes . still playing almost everyday , never thought i would leave a comment for the game. Art/gameplay/rewards are good for free player (just slow a bit leveling your card) . one thing i hate clash royale , is the server always stuck at 50%/75% load up ? my internet working fine and fast , the developer need to upgrade the server as it's quite slow when i load up the game."
Brian Richter,3,2025-10-29 15:08:42,"I have been playing this game since its release, coming back to the game now is a disappointment. I have every card except one of the new ones, yet the evolutions are what ruin it for me. you have to pay to get them if you weren't playing when they released, and even then you'd have to have the clash pass which costs money. evolutions are essential to win games and that makes this game very much pay to win. I used to get excited about a legendary and now its dull, pls fix the game."
Jad Reslan,1,2025-10-18 06:33:57,"money hungry company, ruined the game, no way to enjoy unless you spend 30 dollars to upgrade 1 card, and get matched with the most pay to win, spam, no brain people who just do nothing other than pay their way to the top, while the game supports it, they dont care about regular players anymore, all they want is money, money and money. ruined a game that I played for years for money."
Blaise Hytrek,1,2025-10-23 05:58:37,"Pay to win, crashes constantly if you don't have the best wifi to ever exist, several STEEP paywalls, your opponent will always have better stuff than you, horrible balancing, you could spend several hours just to make ZERO progress, clans instantly kick you if you're less than beyond perfect, every enemy is a meta-chaser/spammer"
Suhan Chhetri,1,2025-11-02 01:23:36,There is a player who keeps joining my clan and is very abusive and cusses me and my clan players very badly but inspite of me kicking him and reporting the chats several times he is still able to join the clan again and again and this is not healthy for the clanmates. Pls take actions against players who reported multiple times and are kicked several times from the same clan and never let them join the clan. Please this is a request!
Luoku Luoku,1,2025-10-17 19:51:33,"this game is like PAY TO WIN CHESS, I'm free to play (haven't spent a single penny on this game), I win like 3 games in a row and the fourth opponent has just straight up spent 20 bucks on this game (which means all his cards are much higher level than mine), he places one expensive (in elixir) card and even with perfect defense you are forced to spend like double the elixir he spent on one card, and then I finally defend, and he places yet another overly upgraded card which leads me to losing.."
Ronnie Proebstel,3,2025-10-27 18:47:16,"Rating Lowered.. Been Playing Since Launch. The game is really dropping in enjoyment and becoming Pay to Win. Matchmaking no longer exists it's just trophy-based, so we commonly see level 12 tower players vs level 15 (a Big in-game difference) absolutely no chance at a win for the lower levels in these matches. Especially against pay-to-win players."
Bilal47,2,2025-10-31 00:13:16,"I like this game, I really do. but the thing is, they ruined it. F2P players are stuck and cannot keep up with everything, so you have to buy things (P2W). They removed chests and the season shop... Two main sources of free progression are now gone, not to mention nostalgia of chests. Supercell, fix these things, and I might give a better review. Btw, new cards and card evos are broken, they need a fix, I have deleted this game and encourage everyone to do so, and for the reader: do NOT install."
Jacob Colby,2,2025-11-04 11:52:35,"would give it 5, but they take away merge tactics for a season after it appears. Just keep merge tactics permantly. Why get rid of it? It's the only reason i have the app downloaded. The evolutions are a little OP and a grind to get a lot of them if you don't pay. Thirdly, you can't edit your war deck for 24 hours after you use it. How am I supposed to adjust my deck if I forget what I needed from my battle 24 hours ago, and the matchmaking is dumb when my lvl 12 cards are up against lvl 15."
Ron C,1,2025-11-01 01:49:07,"The matchups are often ridiculous. You have opponents, putting out 3 and 4 high elixir cards almost simultaneously, while you can't put anything out. You can usually tell very early in a game when you have no chance. it's deflating it's not fun it's absurd...."
suva konto,1,2025-10-30 11:59:10,"After many years the hacker problem has not been fixed, got 7 hackers in a row, the only way to get rid of them is to buy anything from the shop. Also at random times when I have internet it says that I don't and my opponent gets a free 3 crown."
Dynasty,1,2025-10-28 01:08:07,what absolute greed does to a great game. they completely butchered the rewards system and are trying to serve its scraps back to us. you loved getting the huge chests after winning a game? lol not anymore. your now limited to 4 whole daily chests that only give you 1 single random card or it could be only gold. you thought this game was pay to win before then dont even bother trying to think about the game now. the devs are just money hungry (bad word) people. ruined an amazing game.
Jackson Walthall,1,2025-10-25 00:53:14,"Genuinely the worst game I have ever played. I have played for over 5 years now. I can't stop playing, but jesus is it horrible. The game somehow always finds a way to give you hope just till the end of an arena, then BOOM 6 back to back games of full counters to your deck reseting the past 40 minutes of gameplay like it never happened. If you haven't started playing this game, don't start...save yourself from this eternal torment."
M Hamilton,3,2025-11-02 01:39:30,new review: stop resetting merge tactic trophies or whatever they are called. if its a month its definitely not long enough and resetting it all the way to zero is pretty annoying considering the slog of free games you have to get through. if you want to reset it every month like this you have to do multipliers dependent on rank like you do for ranked modes on this game and brawl stars. not happy to get back on after a while and finding out i have to yet again start over
Louis Justin,1,2025-10-21 13:25:00,"this game is just a pain in the arse mate. I remember the good ol time when me and my brother started playing this game, oh boy it was fun remembering it. but they just gotta kill the joy out of it, they made the game cash grab and literally luck based I play this game for over 2-3 years and still everything they did is just killing their own game. like removing the event shop, and every update that just feels too repetitive I mean every update is just another evo and useless event. pls fix this"
Izaul Zapata,1,2025-10-25 11:21:57,"dosent give returning people anything and its annoying players also, I can't change my username which i hate because my username is really bad and I don't want other players seeing that username and everything has became pay to win and in the shop 80%, of everything is just stuff you gotta pay for and the shards are impossible to get like you need to reach level 70 just to get 1 shard out of 6 and everything is just bad the players and the game with all of these microtransactions."
Anthony Chen,5,2025-11-03 09:40:43,"amazing game and core part of my life, def should download and play. tho it does have a few problems, but it fluctuates, and i believe that the problems will be put down soon. one thing we could make clash better is i wish we could PUT SHOES ON ARCHER QUEEN SO I CAN FOCUS ON THE GAME INSTEAD OF THE ONE CARD"
Matthew Cannon,1,2025-11-03 22:38:05,"they are removing ways for you to get cards for free. Got rid of chest can't earn them anymore, you can only buy them now. knew the game was going down hill when you could buy every evolution card. always on sale always heros for sale trying to force the customer to buy the cards. it's going to take over a year of playing straight to earn all the cards for free. Then not even the fact the everyone and there mom buys up to lvl 15 cards. pay to play game"

Brad Denn,1,2025-10-16 20:32:36,"With full wifi and cell service at home, the app constantly locks up saying no connection. Even when just looking at cards and not in a match.

Ervin Encomienda,1,2025-10-24 22:27:21,updating my review to 1 star. this game worsens by the day because of the uncompetitive devs and you money hungry overseers of this game. literally making more promotional offers on the whole screen on every tab rather than making the interface simpler and the user experience tolerable at least. all i see are offers anywhere i look on the screen. there's more ads on the main menu/central log of the game than malice websites for crying out loud! you made one of the best games i've played garbage.
bostito menos,1,2025-10-23 21:09:07,"Clash royale you dont give to the needs of the actuall player base , but the pros. cycle decks are way too common and it doesn't make sense to be able to play a card within 5 seconds of the last time played, it doesn't make sense. plus the immunity some cards have when you predict them such as goblin gang. and hog rider always getting a hit in. it seems as if you only balance to the wants of the pros rather than what truly is fair. this game is pushing away from being skilled < brain dead decks"
Dario Cao Hartono,1,2025-10-19 15:59:57,Now whenever I try to login to clash royale I'm always stuck at 75%. I searched up online and found out it was because of my WiFi and there was no solution to this. I hope this game can fix this solution and I have spent a huge sum of money on this game too
Taj Črešnar,1,2025-11-05 00:29:08,"First i thought this game was good, but after 1 update it ruined everything, so many no skill cards and so many little kids who got to high trophies with no skill and no brain. i quited and came back adter 2 years and nothing changed. i really like this game, but players are just brainroted and just play to flex trophies, but no skill. I woud delete Mega knight, that woud make the game more playble. And one last thing, pay to win got out of control"
Ryan Gray,2,2025-10-12 22:28:47,"Fun game, but 100% pay to win. It be really nice if they had a free to play version with ads is fine and then a pay to win version and split them. I quit playing a long time but came back to try it and it's the same. You'll just got a rank where people have way higher cards, special. cards, etc that they bought and unless you want to spend money or grind your 9 years, you are just stuck. There is definately skill to the game and you can't outplay people, but at some point you can't outplay."
Stefan,4,2025-10-24 19:13:37,This games is extremely competitive and I love that. The cards you collect and use is addictive you always want to improve and climb up the areas but one one down fall is you get people that are far far far mpre advanced and the cards level is alot higher than your and its not very easy to get a hit on tower
Самуил Петров,1,2025-10-25 13:51:58,Worst game ever. 80% of the games I played above 10k trophies are full of bots that play beat down and you can't do anything to stop them and when you play with a real person it's someone who has everything maxed and plays the stupidest combo of card that makes you want to throw your phone through a wall and if I could I would give this game 0 stars.And every second season add a super broken evolution that makes the game unplayable.
Dominium,5,2025-10-29 17:06:35,"I deleted my fairly scathing review, and after returning to this game years later, they have actually fixed a lot of the old problems and made the game a bit better for f2p, and lowered prices by a lot on p2w stuff. I know we won't realistically ever get a ""perfect game"" from any dev team, but when I see the dev team actually address some issues, despite waiting so long that they killed their super popular game, it does give hope. I hope more changes and adjustments are incoming."
Robert Rissanen,1,2025-10-29 22:05:19,I'm very dissapointed in the clear pay to win direction this game is going. I'm a returning player and the new evolutions cards are unfair and almost impossible to get as a f2p player. Such powerful cards shouldn't be accessible only behind a paywall. Also why isn't there any compensation for duplicates? Its such a basic thing that almost every other games have it too. Its crazy that a mutli-billion dollar company can't do that.
Dukkyboyee,4,2025-11-01 10:37:33,"Overall great game, fun to play, easy to set up. Supercell makes it really easy to connect with friends as well by creating clans. Mostly kind playerbase and beginner friendly. my only problem is that a lot of good cards are unlocked through money."
Eli Cochran,1,2025-10-09 11:27:38,"This game is absolutely terrible. Match making system is broken. Nothing is more fun than being matched up against someone who is higher level than you and who is using cards that you don't have. Everyone is using the same play style and there isn't any variety to the game. If you want to spend a ton of money on the game then it MIGHT be fun for a while, but why bother? Update: they just added evolution to increase the pay to win incentive. If you want to progress then you have to pay to win."
Brian Hiltbrand,1,2025-10-07 12:21:22,"They haven't fixed many of the issues that have been in the game since the release of the game. I downloaded the game again to see if they fixed anything? The answer is that they've added even for issues and haven't fixed anything. Also, my entire game data has been deleted since the last time I logged in 6 months ago. another reason to stay away from this shady company that if you put a negative review up, they delete your game data."
LinziHonez,1,2025-10-09 19:57:39,"Supercell are ILLEGALLY using bots to force losses. You will literally not win a single game if you don't buy the season pass, (which is reaching extortionate levels of pricing every season), or the £60 bundles every month when they bring out some new super op card that you won't stand a chance against if you're not spending money. Game is an absolute joke, I wish I could give zero stars."
Fleek Flam,4,2025-10-12 10:20:37,"I've been playing for almost 10 years now and if you're looking for a highly skilled competitive game this is for you since it offer's different strategies and requires quick thinking, but the problem is when it comes to the game if you have not spent at least 20-40 dollars in diamond passes you will struggle A LOT due to the amount of rewards and how much it actually progresses players. Other than that the game is a 4/5 in my opinion."
Sawyer Cressler,5,2025-10-17 10:46:05,"Clash Royale is my favorite game because it mixes strategy, skill, and excitement perfectly. Every battle feels different, and winning a close match is the best feeling ever. I love building decks, predicting my opponent’s moves, and improving each season. The game’s characters, updates, and community keep it fun, and no matter how long I play, it never gets old."
Anthony Gichane,4,2025-10-13 21:23:42,"Everything is good for the most part but I play on PC and for some reason in merge tactics, Archer Queen, Royal Ghost, and one of the goblin characters always crashes the game. This started with the recent season, previously there were no such issues. Sometimes I can't even open up the game again until the match has ended. Please fix this."
daksh kadave,1,2025-10-08 10:03:02,"It is worst when it comes to rank system. I was playing against a player who has more level, more epic cards but he was on same rank as me. And the rank system placed him to play with me and 8 lost in a instance. Every time, the game lags even more and I suffer a severe loss. This eventually does not promote me to other arena Also, the game only gives me gold instead of cards and it lags so much that I have lost 5 to 6 games because of this loss. Please resolve these issues as soon as possible."
Huy Dinh,3,2025-10-07 09:15:44,white outline around the cards like they got copied and pasted. Merge tactics just start inverting colors and makes it unplayable which was sad because that would be the only playable thing in this game on google play games because the lag and loading time to get to a normal match is enough for the opponent to kill you. Generally surprised but still needs a lot of fixing.
Raylynn Stevens,2,2025-10-11 00:45:49,"Wonderful gameplay and fun to do. But the Amount of changes has me "" not wanting "" to play as much. Due to Health Changes to High Mana Creatures. Increase Health in low mana creatures. Plus, in clan war search. Sometimes I will face lower level opponents. Much care for the makers. now changed towards 3 stars. Again, low mana creatures shouldn't be able to defeat high mana creatures within less than 2 seconds now. Starting to get frustrating, having to edit my decks non-stop for these updates"
Noah Meyers,5,2025-10-10 07:21:15,"A Fantastic Strategy Game! Review: ★★★★★ Clash Royale is an absolutely addictive game that combines strategy, skill, and a bit of luck! I love the variety of cards and the way they can be combined to create unique strategies. Each battle feels fresh and challenging, with endless opportunities for tactical play. The graphics are vibrant and the animations are smooth, making each match visually engaging. The matchmaking system is fair, ensuring I compete against players of similar skill"
maddox houston,1,2025-10-08 12:57:44,"I have had my account for 5 years and I had used a very old email that I no longer had access to. I contacted their customer support they ask me to give them my account information keep in mind all im trying to do is change my email. I give them my trophy count, username, ID, tag, clan, and exact xp amount and even after all of this they can't let me change my email? terrible player support ive never been responded to in less than 8 hours it even feels like I'm talking to an ai not a human."
Ishayu Paul,1,2025-10-14 10:14:55,"when I first downloaded, it was fine, but as you get deeper into the game, you face soo many people who use money to get early access to cards or extra elixir, and it's just annoying, not wanting to spend money on a game, but being forced to. Supercell always makes games pay to win, and its super annoying playing people who pay to win."
Marco Vermaak,1,2025-10-07 09:52:35,"really disappointed in the little care supercell has for it's clients, they can't respond to reviews and when they do it's a bot that answers you. awesome games but the data costs are way to much so download if you have money to waste but if you don't want to to lose all your mobile data in three minutes than rather skip this games, any supercell games for a matter of fact."
Bryan Netz,1,2025-10-08 20:08:25,Game just keeps getting worse with the 6 month update taking the good free items and making them less and less worth going for. It is most definitely a pay to win game on top of them constantly putting you against players that have all of your decks shut down cards. Everytime it updates I have to keep reupdating it as well. sometimes twice a day!
Mark Haynes,2,2025-10-13 00:29:36,"Meh, it's jumped the shark now. Server constantly drops me in the middle of a fight with such regularity that I am shocked when it doesn't happen. No way to turn off the chest opening animation, because being forced to tap my phone several times for no reward (I'm maxed out except for the new card) is not nearly as much fun as the Dev Team thinks it is. Also, all the tweaks over the years still has yet to address the uberdeck of the 2.6 agro Hog Rider."
Samuel R,1,2025-10-13 15:13:18,"A GAME OF WALES AND 13 YEAR OLDS. The game is fun if the match is balanced, but that only happens on special occasions. otherwise, you will face off against someone who has spent way too much money for the newest release of cards because they are always broken to be OP. As a long-time player, this really hurts the desire to play. Match making is also broken. If the AI wants you to lose, it will subtly make your elixir spawn in slower than your opponent. OR it will slightly buff your opponent."
Jr Monroe,2,2025-11-03 03:54:38,The game is pay to win. The game is basically now pay to play. Everyone is over leveled with maxed cards and I'm here with level 10s and 12s. Of course it's another game ruined by the developers being greedy for money and not the players.
Yeremy Mendoza,5,2025-10-26 06:55:48,"a Hello, in my opinion this game is very fun since you can make battles with your friends in different game modes, just like the competitive mode or playing in the clan, at first it is obvious that you have been Difficult, oh it will get boring, but after a while it becomes a competitive game since there are always mini events like challenges, clan wars, climbing arenas, etc., but from my point of view From the 2 years I've been playing, I think it's a very fun game and that's all I have to say."
Abraham Gideon,1,2025-10-12 10:19:00,"They have made it pay to win. Players who have spent years get upstaged by new players who can just throw money at it. Ranked battles at 15000 trophies is a scam, might as well make it 150000. Clear case of greed destroying a good game. No 2v2 battles, no party mode and the clan battles are a farce. Clearly the devs don't read any of the reviews because all the recent changes have been exactly opposite to what players want."
Subh Shah,3,2025-10-24 15:10:50,"I've only played the game for a few months, and it's already feeling repetitive, I go up an arena I have an insane win streak and the second im a single trophy away, I verse the biggest p2w player who has every single evo known in the game and I drop down to the bottom of the arena and be on it for weeks, I would only recommend this games if you are willing to pay 1000s of dollars for all the exclusive update bs"
shivansh rs,1,2025-10-23 20:52:29,"Very bad game. It used to be so good but now it's just pay to win it's impossible to win unless u buy a certain item from the store. The chest draws are absolute garbage. The opponent always somehow has faster elixir and better decks with exact counter for your deck. Don't waste ur time on this. Ull be stuck on the same trophy count for a year. I hate this game, how is it that the opponent always has my exact counter, I'm being able to beat people 4000 trophies above me, absolute garbage"
Maxime Gagnon (Thurinum),5,2025-11-01 00:24:45,"I think this is one of the best RTS out there. It's super well designed, quick paced, challenging and no game feels the same. It's fun to play with your friends and alone too. A lot of people complain that it's pay to win, and while that is true, it's not pay to win enough to prevent you from climbing the ranks of ladder (it just takes longer). My best friends got to 15k trophy over a few years without spending a dime - mind you, the game is fun even in lower arenas. He he he haw lol"
Lincoln M.,3,2025-10-22 11:15:59,"This game makes it so you fight in a regular match, but the player that you are fighting has a large number of cards you don't have. And when that happens, your cards don't really stand a chance. So that reason makes the game a lot harder to play and more frustrating for the players. But sometimes the matches that I play are still pretty fair, so that is why my rating is in the middle. So if the game made a change that you could be able to fight players that have the same cards that you have."
Kinley Wasser,1,2025-10-20 14:38:20,"super disappointed. I love this game, it's great for passing time. However, today I was loading into the game as usual to collect my daily chests when I was sent to the main screen to have to relogin. I attempted to relogin with my supercellid, to no advail. sometimes it'll load, sometimes it won't, and it's not an issue on my end I've checked. it simply won't send me the verification code even when it does load despite my email being correct. support apparently isn't available in my region. lol"
Ayush Bansal,1,2025-10-28 22:30:42,"This game is not good for mental sanity. some decks will have hard counter to whatever u play and in that sense matchmaking is not fair. what cards you want to play are different and what cards u get are based on luck. resources are limited. I had bought the royal pass. but I don't want to buy every royal pass to upgrade troops. troop upgrade take forever, for last 9 years i am playing still troops are upgrading and I don't have cards I want to play so. I quit."
Conrad Brosky,1,2025-10-10 09:57:51,"I came back to this game after 3 years its still as horrible as when I left you cant progress at all unless if you pay to win the game literally. the game is based on levels of cards, the higher the level the more powerful, and you can buy your way to higher levels. this is fine but the game matchmaker you in mid ladder, mid game, against people who have spent 200 dollars on the game, and its every game, ive been stuck in the same spot for 3 weeks in arena 19. DO NOT DOWNLOAD"
Gavin Beebe (CoviMelon),1,2025-10-13 21:31:39,"This game is a lot of fun and can be so addicting, but it is so pay to win. They have these cards that are called evolution cards, just the regular cards but way more powerful, and they all cost money. it's disgusting how many people buy them and it makes the game unplayable for people that don't want to spend money on it. Don't support them by buying those evo cards, because as long as they are making that much money, they won't care."
Hisham khaled,1,2025-10-18 15:39:38,"The game isn't fair any more the evolution is ruining the game at first I played vs much higher levels but this was a little acceptable, but now I have to play vs a player who has like almost all his Cards with evolution and I don't have single one? because for me that game isn't fair anymore..you can delete the evolution to make fairness in the game play or make evolution part of the challenges.but to make it in the trophy this sucks"
Mani Shankar M,1,2025-10-24 14:03:43,"Now you have to pay for almost everything. They have removed Books from shop which could be bought with gems. Previously extra cards were converted to wild cards, now they convert into elite wild cards. No one even asked for Lvl 15 , for which you have to collect 50k elite wild cards which is insane. At higher leagues even level 14 is underleveled which limits players to play only few decks.Also bring back season shop!"
Veronica Baisar,1,2025-10-12 11:40:20,"Honestly, I used to enjoy Clash Royale, but over time, it just started to suck for me. The biggest problem is how pay-to-win the game feels. If you’re not spending money, you're basically stuck grinding for weeks just to level up a single card, while someone who drops some cash can max theirs out instantly. It’s incredibly frustrating to go into matches knowing you played better, but still lost because your opponent’s cards are two levels higher. Yall fvk with apples tho?"
Bot Twelve,2,2025-10-29 21:04:14,brutal. the firecracker unit has ruined the game these are medieval units while the firecracker has a explosive gun you cannot attack your opponent on any level while they use it. time to take it out guys it's killing your game plus the mother witch is supposed to counter minion hordes but it's attack speed and low hp make it useless making you have to choose poisen it's pretty easy to observe...
Dooms Day,1,2025-10-17 14:25:36,"Why do you always pair me with a level 15 opponent when I'm just level 14? It's truly unfair to play with them and have a low chance to win even if you strategize your gameplay. And also I noticed that some players have faster elixir regeneration compared to mine, that's why I'm suspecting that some of them are cheaters."
Jennifer Barradas,2,2025-10-30 20:14:30,"the game is so good, but if you pay, and buy cards or coins you always are going to win, that's horrible, bad idea because is you don't pay, it appears like the opponent has more cards, more elixir, it's like he or she always have card to play"
Abhinav Sajeev,4,2025-10-23 01:48:32,"This game is good, but I find it pay to win also. Being able to buy champions when you didn't even resch the arena required is so unfair. If I were to suggest changes, it would be to make the purchases of specific champions or evolutions unavailable until you unlock the character or arena to make it fair for everyone."
Dean Halter,1,2025-10-07 01:18:41,The game is hardly worth playing. It takes unbelievably long to level up. the only way to get cards is to get on everyday and win up to 4 games for loot boxes that give barely anything. So it requires at least 20 minutes everyday for months to get cards leveled up so that you can climb ladder. It's not fun.
TheShortDude,1,2025-10-21 12:35:12,most pay to win game of all time. To top it off there is no such thing as fun in this game. everyone plays the meta and if you want to try other cards ever that are under leveled you cant because you will instantly be demolished by some meta deck played by a guy who spent $500 on the game
lev1athan,1,2025-11-02 21:18:15,I've played for a long time and hate it the more years pass. Fun fact! Never nerfing the most used cards so that people will spend more money to level them is stupid. Did I mention that everyone uses the EXACT SAME DECKS EVERY SINGLE GAME because of it? I'm stuck using the same thing every game because if I changed it then I'd never win because their max level cards would easily beat my underleveled ones no matter what I used. I'M SORRY I CAN'T SPEND ALL MY MONEY ON YOUR STUPID GAME.
Kacper Dobrzynski,1,2025-10-07 02:51:38,At first the game is fun but as you get in the later stages of the game you verse players who spend ridiculous amounts of money on the game to have max level cards. They remove the season shop and chests so free to play players are unable to progress. Also instead of nerfing the broken cards they buff or just leave them as is. Your unable try out new decks as all your resources are sapped into 1 deck.
Tino Noelle,2,2025-10-22 09:28:58,"All in all, pay to win unless your maxed leveled which takes years. Every other update it gets harder to progress without paying money. Event rewards are often less worth then a single chest. The current seasonal Chests can turn into a 5 Star and give you a Banner that you already gain as the next reward. Fun concept destroyed by micro transactions and focus on profit. Very rare bugs but loosing a rare drop with important progress is crushing, support can't even react after months. Disappointed"
Alek Madzharov,1,2025-09-11 20:11:42,"The game is no longer fun and it can never return to what it was years ago. The changes are very unfriendly to returning players who don't have access to evolutions, higher levels or even Ranked battles. The game currently has 2 modes (1v1 and Merge Tactics) which is a far cry from the Party button that offered ever-changing events. F2P still struggle in ladder and especially Clan wars. And all of this devolution is offered at a higher prise that will only increase in the future."
Rangrez Mohd Saif,1,2025-10-12 03:51:01,"I am getting the same 3 worst modifiers in merge tactics that is Ultimate Origins, Master Arena and Trait Dummy all three of them are really boring to play and for some reason I'm always getting any one of the above it is very rare for me to get any other modifier and special Mention to Ascension because if i don't get these 3 then this is the one that is repeated the most"
Hasooni,2,2025-10-16 19:54:09,"I have been playing the game since 2016, and a huge issue has yet to be solved: Matchmaking. I've been stuck in the same Arena and Merge Tactics league for MONTHS due to the absolute HORRIBLE matchmaking, it matches me up against way higher level players, besides that the game is pretty good."
TROY JACKSON,1,2025-10-21 04:50:25,"They introduced level 15, made the upgrade pay to win, and ruined the game, Glad I don't have to wait for troop to be built, was a Great live strategy game. It took me 3hrs to get your email, you completely stuffed this update in Oct 25."
Prishaa Badhwar 1 6602,5,2025-10-15 19:56:20,"Best strategic game ever really nice game . I have been playing this for like 2 to 3 years , it has been treating me very well. I have reached 6000 trophies (F2P) . Only one problem I have with this game is of free evo shards, they are very less available. So, I would love if the Clash Royale team focuses more on this problem."
Chris Raymonio,1,2025-08-31 13:18:38,"it took me years to reach 10000,, and all of a sudden when you be in the middle of a battle the connection automatically lost. making you login again only to see that you have lost. sometimes the game automatically freezes too. Very annoying when you're having network issues, and when you have a phone call just know that it's all over. Rubbish.... BUT ADDICTIVE 💯"
Jai Pedersen,5,2025-09-03 04:24:22,"Clash Royale is a fast-paced strategy game that blends tower defense, collectible card battles, and real-time multiplayer action. Players build decks using cards representing troops, spells, and buildings, then face off against opponents in three-minute duels where quick decision-making is key. Its mix of strategy and skill makes it highly competitive yet easy to pick up. The game’s balance of free-to-play progression and in-app purchases can be frustrating at times, but still very fun."
Terence Marasigan,2,2025-09-12 18:54:54,"The game is really fun to play. But pay2win is becoming a huge problem within the game. It loses its fun when having matchups where the enemy has a far higher leveled cards than I do. Making the match one-sided and unfair for the free to play player. Please supercell, fix the matchmaking. Where people only get matched with opponents that have equally leveled cards."
Chris Hill,1,2025-08-22 05:20:07,"updated and now I can't log in after 7 years of data. If you're starting a new game, find a different one, this one is toast. devs don't care it's all about the money. playability has been trash for years! tons of ux updates no one asked for just to polish the fact the matchmaking is garbage. fix the real issues and don't put out an update that kicks your player base."
Autumn ToPpY (Snowy),1,2025-09-14 19:36:24,"The game itself is good, but I feel like the developers only care about money now, rather than enjoyment, especially because of the ""kingly offerings"" event and buying evolution shards, while people that don't have the ability to, and actually want to enjoy the game get pretty much told pay or get out because of the matchups. (it's near impossible to progress being free to play.) I hope this game someday improves, because this is just disappointing"
Trevor Linke,1,2025-09-06 22:24:30,Great game but they got rid of all skill. once they added evolutions they ruined the game and I stopped playing. No more skill or grind to play the game. Keep in mind I have been playing for 10 years now. That completely ruined it for me and my friends and we all have basically maxed accounts. With this we will never play again. They just are money hungry. Pay to win.
Matthew Quinn,3,2025-08-26 22:16:13,"This game used to be phenomenal. Great graphics and smooth gameplay. Unfortunately, the game developers have chosen a more ""Pay to Win"" style, and gameplay shows. You work to upgrade cards in a deck and then battle other players' decks. If you're good, you'll level up quick and the rewards are aplenty. Unfortunately, no matter what you will find yourself at a skill cap where only those who spend $$$ get to progress, the infamous ""Mid-Ladder"". Be prepared for an experience full of highs and lows."
J Austria,2,2025-08-15 02:38:44,"This game has been out for nearly a decade and it was once one of the best games you can have on a moblie device. This is no longer the case. It is now the filled with greed and thousands of predetory style of microtransaction which is aims towards younger people. It's sad to see a game I love and loyaly play through out the years to turn into something this awful. This is free to download, but it is not anwywhere close to being a ""free to play"" game. If youre a new player, find something else."
niko ludovic,2,2025-09-26 20:41:11,"Typical PAY-TO-WIN game, with a hilarious algorithm. Very often, in easy battles, the connection suddenly lags and delays. Only after the opponent gains the upper hand does it return to normal. The matchmaking algorithm is also too obvious. When we're forced to lose by the algorithm, it will select an opponent with a counter-strategic deck. Clash Royale isn't a game to prove skill; it's just a casual game for those who pay for the pass. For free players, keep dreaming of a fair and exciting game"
K W,1,2025-09-23 06:34:21,This game is rigged. Been trying to get to max trophies for years now. Every time I'm one win away I get matched against someone who perfectly counters my deck. Begin the loss streak. Once this happens I won't get another win until I fall almost all the way down to the bottom of the arena I'm in. Another thing is that the opponents elixir usage doesn't add up when this happens. Over and over I've counted their elixir and mine at the same time. Not equal...and yes I know how to use it efficiently
Ian Mertens,1,2025-08-18 19:26:35,"This game sucks since last updated. No battle is even interesting, since sometimes your enemy does not even respond, while other times the enemy can deploy more elixir than you even produce. there is no way in hell this game is even fair and I doubt if you even play against other real players. It is very clear that players who pay, win. This is not about strategy anymore, but about money. The last updates ruined the game completely."
Dylan RogersYT,1,2025-08-24 08:52:02,"The game has unfortunately shifted toward a pay-to-win model. It used to have a balanced ranked mode where everyone had access to level 11 cards, creating a fair competitive environment. Now that mode is gone, and it feels like the focus is more on monetization than gameplay. It's a disappointing direction for what used to be a great game.😕😪"
Travis Davis,1,2025-08-23 14:16:32,"Over the years, this game has devolved into a giant cash grab. I mean, whats even the point of calling it a strategy game when you can be in arena 1 and go against max level cards. I still play because when all is said and done its a fun game, but pay to win has just completly spiralled out of control, to the point where i wanna uninstall."
Raphael ANS,1,2025-08-26 14:17:41,"This game has almost lost its fun and balance element, and while playing, I encountered several frustrated players. And for ""Merge Tactics"" it should be replaced with ""Merge Luck"" because it's not based on tactics but luck, after reaching 2500 and 2800, there will be a clear imbalance in the random distribution of cards. Playing 3x &3 winning the first order from 2800 to 2889 then the next 3 rounds will most likely drop back to the 2800-2820 area, this wastes 15 to 24 minutes of time. Not fun!!!"
Martin,1,2025-08-18 14:18:43,"The game is hot garbage. I am 9k trophies level 13, every third game there is someone P2W level 15 with maxed out cards, making it almost impossible to climb if you don't spend at least a month to level up to level 14 or don't pay real money. And you can't even buy anything good with money unless you throw hundreds of dollars at the game."
Yanko Greshkov,1,2025-08-16 15:55:58,"Don't play it in 2025! The game's progression is screwed as a F2P player. Opponents usually are 1-2 card levels above you, which means their 5 elixir troop will wipe out everything you have, regardless of how well you play. The game uses EOMM, which means every other game you get thrown in against bots, which makes wins feel meaningless. Chests and card drops don't give you nearly enough on a daily basis to level up anything. Check recent reviews and you'll see players leaving the game en masse."
Daniel Lipka,1,2025-08-21 13:43:29,"I love what this game used to be. Overall great game, no bloatware and no ads. greatest mobile game of all time. however this game is pay to progress, the game intentionally matches you with hard counters and pass royale players so you dont win, get frustrated and buy their microtransactions. overall 1/5. love the concept but it's impossible to progress without swiping your credit card. I'd rather watch ads but have a playable game then an unplayable game with no ads."
Marco Antonio Cortés S.,1,2025-09-02 09:09:33,"They've completely forgotten about trade tokens and magic coins; I can hardly even get a book without buying them. They've removed a lot of things that were used to level up and they didn't add anything in its place, the pass royale is more of the same, they removed many things by putting levels that you will hardly take advantage of"
Luke Dunn,1,2025-08-31 07:03:47,"After 7 years of playing this game, today is the day I delete it for good! The P2P requirement is just ridiculous now and the evolution element has completely ruined the game. Out of every 10 games I reckon I play the exact same deck at least 5-6 times. The fun has completely gone and the players with money buy their way to the top! Such a shame as I've loved this game for so many years, but unfortunately like every other aspect of life, greed takes over and money always come first."
Adarsh Pidugu,1,2025-09-29 07:03:55,"Clash Royale may be one of the most popular mobile games in the world, but anyone who has actually played it knows the frustration runs deep. After losing yet another game, I can confidently say this app has more problems than positives, and here are several reasons why Clash Royale simply sucks. 1. Pay-to-Win Mechanics The biggest issue with Clash Royale is that it rewards players who spend money rather than players who actually have skill. Someone with a maxed-out Mega Knight doesn’t even nee"
Naufal Mahfudz,1,2025-10-04 04:23:16,"The game is getting more and more pay to win. They give some free resources once in a while, but that's not enough. It is even worse if you are a new player or a returning player. You'll feel left out because you just don't have any evolved cards you want, even if you already grinded for weeks. Matchmaking and servers are usually terrible as well. New cards are usually overpowered, making you spend your money to get it, and then they'd nerf it. Thumbs up for successfully destroying the game."
egkoieghs hersges,5,2025-09-14 08:59:40,"Clash is one of the most fun games ever because it combines strategy, excitement, and creativity all in one. Players get to build their own base, train troops, and come up with unique battle strategies to defeat opponents. Every match feels different, and the challenge of outsmarting other players makes it endlessly entertaining. On top of that, the graphics and animations keep the gameplay fresh and enjoyable, making it easy to get hooked for hours. This game also deserves 5 stars because it"
Allan,1,2025-08-29 21:22:17,"Like all mobile games, it seems fun for a while, then it becomes increasingly difficult to progress unless you pay. They all have a gambling feel to it, i.e. you win some, you lose more. Clash Royale is exactly the same. Great way to get people addicted and waste all their time and money. I have uninstalled this game."
Eric,1,2025-08-16 12:33:32,"I dont know how long support has been nothing but an automated bot with limited reply options, as I used it today for the first time in ages, but its absolutely horrible. There isnt a way to talk to a human to report problems and I cant stand it. Ive been playing this game on and off since it was released, ive stuck through a lot of bad direction choices gameplay-wise, but this is something I just cant abide by. I wont be playing this game again until you can talk to an actual human for support."
Eric Hartanto,2,2025-10-01 21:25:01,"After over a year break, I reinstalled this game after seeing the ad for old players. Sadly, the same issue still exists: CONSTANT DISCONNECTIONS! Even with full 4G signal or stable Wi-Fi, the game suddenly disconnects in the middle of a match, while other apps and games run perfectly fine. This has been a problem for years and was the main reason I uninstalled before. The server feels unstable and unreliable, making the whole experience really disappointing!"
Kurtis Lambert,1,2025-08-21 17:02:42,"Prime example of pay to win. I wanted to try it again after years since they updated it so much, and I can see why. You hit walls where you can't progress without buying some of their packs, if you don't you will be placed against people who have much higher leveled soldiers since you can only level them from cards you receive through chests."
Hossain Araf,1,2025-08-20 05:47:43,"Clash Royale is honestly the worst game. I’ve been playing it since 2018, and its algorithm is completely worsen. Once you start losing, it feels impossible to win — like the game forces loss after loss. I can dominate the entire match, but somehow the opponent snatches the win at the very end. It’s so frustrating. I’ve wasted countless hours over the past seven years on this game, and now it just feels like a complete waste of time."
Ernesto Padilla,1,2025-09-12 04:44:24,"its either you win 5 times in a row to finally make it ti the next arena, get 1 win and 1 loss constantly, or lose 5 times in a row. the game is suppost to be ""strategic"" but you cant find a perfect strategy without spending like 20$ in-game because the game REFUSES to give you the cards you need to update your strategy to counter the constant other strategies that perfectly counter your strategy and then your opponents for whatever reason have cards from 3 arenas ahead of the one you are in."
logan gravley,1,2025-09-28 20:35:48,"The bots have infinite elixir. If you don't like to be cheated out of wins, don't play this game. For example, I was in a match and had just played a push when the bot played a goblin hut, fireball, wizard, giant, and a knight for one side, and on the other played a mini pekka and tombstone, and this was not the only time it had happened either."
Xerneasguy1336,1,2025-08-21 22:55:43,"Can't do anything, can't get enough elixir on time for anything. People are pay to win and toxic as heck, this game sucks, the troops/towers aren't good, there is no hope into trying no matter how hard I try to win, I always end up losing, the matchmaking is horrible. There's nothing! It's not fair. Fix your game, Supercell!"
Luke Tuder,1,2025-09-02 10:12:25,I've been playing this game for over a few years now and it's a good game when you're not playing no skill over leveled opponents who you somehow get matched against every game......this game is so money based you cant get anywhere without spending money the first thing you see when you click on the shop is flashing deals in your face immediately and 30 bucks for early access to new cards..... 30 bucks? This game is so pay to win I don't recommend even giving a thought to downloading this game
Mikey,4,2025-08-16 00:03:36,"Everything about the game is top tier except the pay to win aspect is very annoying at times, and the game gets to a point where you literally cannot progress at all because your opponents are to overleveled. Other than that the game is very entertaining/fun."
Claudio Guerrero,1,2025-08-20 05:04:09,"Update This game is clear pay to win. While you're supposed to have the same tower shooting speed since it isn't upgradeable, it is obvious that most enemy towers shoot faster so u die quicker. Opponent mana also fills faster which you can't purchase or alternate so they send several 5 mana characters faster than you can send two 3-4 mana characters. this game clearly incentives to purchase upgrades to even stand a chance. I wouldn't recommend this cheating greedy cash grab pay to win game."
Tanmay T A,1,2025-10-02 21:47:16,"Only Supercell can manage to make a game this simple, a buggy mess. The game constantly crashes and disconnects. The disconnecting issue is especially engaging. It disconnects even when I have a perfectly stable network, and it loves to do so exactly during crucial moments in the match when you're dropping troops to defend a rush."
Logan Davis,2,2025-08-27 11:37:02,"No matter what if you get one or more wins in a play session you will begin to be matched with people with counters and even just overall higher level cards, me with all level 8 and 9 cards sadly can't wipe someone with a level on me in towers and 2 or 3 additional levels in cards. Simply unfun after two or three games. adding this way later,after giving the game another try, game is unplayable after going back after some time. evolutions are required, or you're always gonna be a step behind."
regan robinson,5,2025-09-24 14:04:28,"As a high arena player placed top 50 in the world, iv'e been playing clash since the week it came out, and I have seen how much the game has gone ,up down , and viral, and CRL is truely my favourite game by far, hence the fact that the new updates are terrific, the only bad thing is getting rid of the shop a couple months ago which I think is a disadvantage for lower arena players, becuase of the lack of items to get, anyway very good game highly recomend this, :)"
Highland Cunningham,3,2025-09-29 14:12:16,"There was a clan challenge today that I stayed up until 2am to complete- took each member like 2 hours a piece, and the prize was only 8 tower princess cards. Rewards have gotta be bigger if we're gonna spend THAT much time on something. I know the game is pay to win for the most part, but this is a new low even for clash. Usually you're able to work hard to catch up with the paid players, but this is ridiculous. It showed a fancy silver chest and barely had anything in it."
Deidra karel Bautista,1,2025-08-27 20:21:41,"This game is actual garbage. At release it was a nice game with balanced cards and was fun. Now when i try to do anything my opponent brings out E-Golems, Mega knights and stuff you'll unlock extremely late in the game just in their deck cause they spent money. The game is incredibly pay-to-win and most cards are genuinely insufferable. 1/5 would rate 0 if possible."
Frank Carrillo,1,2025-08-24 00:29:55,"Love the game, been playing since inception, and have multiple accounts across clash of clans and boom beach. The 1 star is for customer service. locked me out of my main account, and after 22 days and multiple attempts to reach out to customer service, I have yet to speak with a real person to recover my account. After all the time and money I've spent. disrespectful!!!!!"
Porticus,1,2025-10-04 14:04:59,"I have been playing since it came out in 2016. The introduction of P2W mechanics was balanced. after a 4 year hiatus, I noticed that the P2W mechanic is extremely present. Most games you are facing someone with Evos and cards ranked 3-4 times higher than yours. It's hard to play if you haven't spent money on the game. It also isn't the typical $1-$2 charge it's $12.99 for a lot of stuff. It's sad to see the quality of this game go so downhill."
HASAN MAHMUD,1,2025-09-22 01:07:56,"Bad and slow servers with frequent in-game lag. The developers should collect and analyze network-related issues for each device. I noticed the game often forces connections through slower servers for the lobby and home screen, even when faster servers are available. There’s no smart network optimization, which makes the experience frustrating."
Knight Wing48,1,2025-09-22 02:54:57,"Decided to give the game a try after all my friends telling me to play it. downloaded it and I cant even get past the ""updating"" screen. its just times out and says i lost connection. ive tried under wifi and data, both of which ive never had issues with for any game and still nothing. im extreamly disappointed cause I cant even play the game."
A Google user,1,2025-10-05 18:05:45,"Absolutely terrible matchmaking and game play. Constantly matched with players leveled above or below you, you either win by a landslide or get destroyed. It's hard to upgrade or advance without spending money. No matter how much you upgrade you'll instantly be capped out by being matched against players above you again. Used to be so fun and insanely addictive, but they somehow totally ruined it, sad!"
Cristian Morillo,1,2025-09-12 00:50:42,"I’m trying to recover an old account I created in 2016 and last played in 2018. I don’t remember the account name or game ID, and I originally signed in using Google Play Games. The account is not connected to Supercell ID. However, it seems that the Google Play Games login option has been removed, and now I can’t access the account. I’ve searched for solutions and found that many others are experiencing the same issue."
Christopher Malone,1,2025-09-02 18:16:11,"Game was great but now gets stuck on the initial loading screen, then goes to updating and a pop-up says it's lost connection. Uninstalled and reinstalled. Still errors out. Internet connection is stable on everything else. Tried emailing regarding issue but they replied back saying to use the app to submit issues. Tried the website and it wants you to sign in but I haven't gotten the emailed code to sign in. Last resort, a 1 star review. Update - the game is working now. No help from support."
Ronald Smith,1,2025-09-15 17:15:29,"Wish we could add the people we battle with to our friends list. (Edit) 4-2* I'm tired of playing the same deck over and over and over again. It's always knight, firecracker, megaknight. I play one of those 3 cards in every battle. If those cards are so good that they get played in literally every match, then maybe they're too good? I main the X bow, so killing them is not a problem. It just takes all of the fun out of the game when every match feels almost like a repeat of the match before."
Dennis Aliy,1,2025-09-15 10:30:22,downloaded it again as I felt nostalgia. played a few games and then started running into players with tower buffs that make them shoot faster and character buffs that make normal characters evolved or whatever that aren't in the base game for players who don't pay 12$ a month for the pass. ridiculous. pay2win has no place in a strategy game
Sivaramakrishnan,2,2025-08-15 10:57:12,"lots of bugs in the recent update. 1. unable to see the battle log. when tapping on the battle log the application gets closed. 2. after completing a battle in competitive mode , the battle mode gets switched automatically to trophy mode. 3. views are not properly aligned for a long time even after a couple of updates. Device: iqoo neo 7 pro."
Senodjati Witjaksono,1,2025-08-29 10:20:14,"I've been playing this game for more than 4 years and not even once I spend money on it. Based on my experience in the past it was quite a challenge to be a free to play player, but after EVOLUTION COMES UP it just ruins the game, every good evolution have to be bought to actually have it, and the chance of having a free evolution TAKE AGES to get. right now I sit at 9000 trophies and the gap between the people who bought the EXPENSIVE EVOLUTION and not, is getting wider each day."
Edward Cole,1,2025-08-23 17:49:39,"Used to be an amazing game, now it's filled with power scaling issues that make the game impossibly difficult to be successful without constantly paying rising prices. The game uses a system designed to maximise player engagement and retention rather than prioritising fair and skill based matchmaking."
Heart Of Death,2,2025-08-21 08:32:45,2 vs 2 game play is the best but they removed it due to them not making money. Now the new 4 person farse of a mode merge tactics is bs. that mode is a way for the devs to make money by inserting more ai and fixing the matches trying to get you to upgrade in fustration at a certain point. I'm sure alot of ppl noticed this after the recent updates. been with the game from the beginning and now it might be time to quit.
Joshua Badillo,3,2025-08-31 23:34:12,"It's a good game indeed. The problem I have and hate so much is how you get matched with decks that load way faster. They mismatch in a way that makes you lose. Also, support does not care about us. I was browsing reviews and noticed they don't try to respond. They love how we spend money(which I stopped)but do not address our concerns as gamers."
Jason Carrasquillo,1,2025-08-22 20:00:48,"Terrible!! Super Cell has screwed this game up so badly with the matchmaking algorithms, evolutions, and the changing of the goblin hut and furnace cards. This used to be one of my favorite games to play, but now I find it so intolerable. Whoever is running the show at Super Cell needs to be fired for ruining what USED to be an awesome game."
JC Coetzee,1,2025-08-21 20:17:51,"The game is currently a complete dumpsterfire. Pay-to-win and ballancing issues is some of the worst I've seen. Bugs that are in the game for months are still not fixed. Servers are laggy and inconsistent. I just experienced a glitch where I can't place anything, forcing me to watch while I loose. This game is in the worst spot its been in. The only reason its not dying is because pipular streamers like Jynxzi decided to start streaming it."
ralph ponce,3,2025-08-18 00:08:29,"Great Game and an boredom buster but the problem is that too many players Pay to win which gives free to play players a hard time to go up in Trophy Roads. Though I would suggest like a ""Pay bases matchmaking"" which mean that only players that pay to win can only fight each other while free to play players can rise through the rankings fairly without their opponent being extremely overleved. Though it's a fun game and I hope someone from the dev team of clash Royal will notice this thanks."
HellZ (Purnayu),4,2025-09-29 21:13:21,"Game is absolutely fantastic, becomes quite addictive. But one thing that there should be some more flexibility to the way you get cards, it becomes more difficult to get later on, there should be some option to watch ads in return for cards."
SHz_Bean,1,2025-09-01 08:44:49,"As the updates continue, the gameplay becomes more and more dependent on how much money you need to spend in order to have fun. The developers are becoming greedier by the second, covering your screen with pop-ups to spend a little bit of money here and there. If you haven't spent a good amount of money on this game, you will never win."
Ye Myat,1,2025-08-30 16:52:24,"This game is now officially pay to win you can easily buy legenddary hero cards and their evolutions straight away with dollarsss there is no need to open chests. How smart you are it doesnt matter just the evo cards matters. The Clan Wars make no sense at all... it takes too long and I keep attacking and attacking but there are several phases to complete. If you are lvl is below 13 is better not to queue cause you can never win, you will be match up against lvl 14,15 or even lvl 13 buyers."
Sepp Bookwood,2,2025-09-11 11:29:01,"The Greed of the Developers is infinite. Once this game was a Realtime Action Chess. now you have to spend 100.000 $ or € to be kinda competitive. look at your own game, everywhere there is a button to pay for the smallest possible improvement, let's be honest, a non-service that is completely overpriced. don't bother to explain yourself, you are ferengi!"
Ihor Ginko,1,2025-08-26 08:54:03,"I used to love this game with passion and competed for rank. But the game balance is a complete mess with the new evolutions and cards being released absolutely broken. I won't lie, the game is fun at lower arenas. But if you want to play on higher level and arenas, the broken cards are basically a must. This means you need to pay for the pass royale. But these cards are nerfed to oblivion in 3 months. I can't wait untill the game balance is back to normal and f2p is an option on higher levels."
Te Bobo,1,2025-09-02 16:36:46,2025 and I still believe that clash Royale is a scam. No matter what strategy you call yourself running this game is designed for you to lose. companies like supercell have taken the fun out of video games. The one thing they got correct is the shop. I believe this game should be banned. It's no different than gambling. The new vine spell is $30 to unlock and upgrade to the max level. Scam! In a real video game rewards are earned not bought.
Gavin O'Brien,1,2025-10-06 00:34:08,"I used to love this game. I haven't played in a while but I came back to give it a try again. What do I come back to? Level 15 evolved Mega Knight. In arena 13. This game is the definition of pay-to-win. I haven't made a single micro transaction at all in the game. It's nearly impossible to make any progress unless you feed the corporate greed. Other than my pay-to-win opponent spamming goblin boohoo every other match, it's fun."
Grayson Miller,5,2025-10-02 07:15:02,If you are looking for a challenging game with more than 100 cards you have come to the right place. Now one thing I would like to say is that when I call this game challenging were talking I won't leave this game until I get to the next arena type challenging but in a fun way to. Each and every card is different from the last but some cards pair good with each other like when you get hog rider you can put the hog behind the mini Pekka to help him get to the tower faster. This an amazing game
Alec Romero,1,2025-09-09 09:52:53,This game is pay to win don't get it. It will put you against players with higher level cards. The tournaments are rigged for pay to play players. I've played since it first came out and it's honestly sad how bad the games gotten since the beginning. Plus you only play against people that base their deck off of tower cards. Like what's the point of playing a game if you're only going to go against a YouTube deck or someone hiding behind their tower cards. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!
A Google user,1,2025-08-17 13:26:48,"Without 2v2,this game is really bad. the game has an algorithm that will try and keep you close to even on your wins/loses just to try and keep you coming back. So 1v1 modes are more competitive and not as relaxed and fun. It can get you so mad that you want to break your phone, so until 2v2 becomes an option again I give this game a 1 star"
Sushant kumar,1,2025-08-30 01:40:04,"since i returned after taking a break from the game, I can't get the evolutions that the opponents have. well i can deal with opponents that have higher lvl cards and evolution. But to add to the problem, we now have tower troop. Which i have no way of getting unless I'm incredibly lucky. Funny how a fair game became a pay to win game in such a short time. I'll stop playing again but permanently this time."
Micah Hong,1,2025-09-27 16:10:51,"Im sorry, if I recalled a game is supposed to let you have fun right? Yet, Ive play this game for 2 years and the P2W situation has never changed. Overleveled units, as a free to play I expect this to be fixed. Yall have earned enough money. If not, this game is beyond save and I will NEVER think of coming back to this game."
Abdul Rafay Yasir,1,2025-09-02 19:27:10,"Amazing game, played for 2 years, but now it just stopped working, it loads to 75%,then it gets stuck on updating, doesn't matter how long I wait, it doesn't work, I deleted and reinstalled, nothing, gave it permission from settings, as I saw in a yt tutorial, still nothing"
Marckuz Abacan,5,2025-08-22 04:29:43,"Clash Royale is a really fun and strategic game that keeps me hooked every time I play. It’s not just about dropping cards randomly – you have to think carefully about timing, placement, and how to counter your opponent’s moves. I like how every battle feels different, and there are so many decks and strategies you can try. The game is fast-paced, exciting, and rewarding, which makes it one of the best mobile games I’ve played."
Clark Jayden Perfiñan,1,2025-09-10 21:52:10,"I have a bad Personal Experience in this game, first and mostly common problem on this game is how much Pay to Win it is. I'm at 8,500 in Trophy Road whilst being level 13, and yet I always matched up with Level 14-15 with level 15 Cards, they just spammed everything at the bridge and it's game over. Second, Clan wars, the most unfair match up in Clash Royale, my Level 12 Accounts always match up with Level 14 with mostly Level 15 cards. Fix the match making, Supercell."
Jessie White,1,2025-08-14 21:23:31,"fun game when you first start out, co worker told me about it. though the farther you get the more it seems like you need to spend money to make more progress. ive been stuck at rank 10 my co worker said you get legends at rank 11 which seems odd to me. it also seems the matchmaking is a little unfair, I win 1 game and think I may make it to rank 11 to get legends, they do look cool and seem OP but then I lose 3 or 4 games in a row and am debating uninstalling the game."
Ravi Teja,1,2025-09-26 23:27:21,"While playing, merge tactics, and when I am in a winning position the cards stop comming, you will have enough excilier but still you will not able to get cards. and slowly you will loose the game. This is the experience I have faced, and I even took the screenshots of that, but unfortunately I cannot attach them here."
Miika Myllynen,1,2025-09-10 16:33:00,"I can't with this game anymore... I started playing so far back and I loved this game! But nowadays it's nothing but pay-to-win and micro transactions, it's horrible. Supercell used to make fun and enjoyable games, now it's just miss after miss and the games that do somehow stay afloat, became riddled with micro transactions... Do better or just stop entirely, this is just bad."
Austen Moores,1,2025-09-18 19:42:09,I used to absolutely love this game I would play every day after school and have a blast. nowadays the game is plagued with people in mid ladder who spend hundreds of dollars to have everything maxed out and I physically can't compete. I wish this game was more focused around the common player rather than the ones who make the game the most money. the matchmaking isn't all that good either I only have 3 level 15s and have a my decks are under leveled but end up fighting players with maxed decks.
Broski,1,2025-09-05 15:46:15,"Been playing for 9 years. One star because of their customer support. It's the worst I've ever seen. For 3 years I've been trying to have all my Supercell games on my 1 main email and they can't help with it. Made new emails to try and sort it out but nope. Even deleted progress to try and replace it.. NOPE. a lady told me what was possible and I went through with it and 2 new agents came and in other words told me I was crazy, lied and told me to kick rocks. Am I asking for too much? Really?!"
Illia Honcharenko,1,2025-09-26 22:15:48,"One of the worst matchmaking systems in online game i ever experienced. If you play well the game will make you face exactly 2-3 levels higher cards opponents, which on higher arenas becomes absolutely unplayable. The only way to upgrade is to donate or play some garbage modes to earn more cards, which you will have to do a lot, since upgrading champions or legendary cards without actually buying them can take months or even years."
fusbis,1,2025-10-02 22:08:05,"one of the worst game I have ever played. Everything about it is just the worst, I mean the game is completely unfair, I mean you play against players that have stuff you unlock many arenas a head and another thing is that when you are about to reach like 3000 trophies the game puts you in a match with a much more skilled player than you and then you lose like 5 times in a row, which is what happened to me and i was only at like 2000 trophies and took ages trying to get to the next arena."
Meta 313,1,2025-09-30 11:32:27,"Too many absolutely annoying cards that allow low skilled players to completely abuse them and win in a vast amount of cheap ways. Also, the matchmaking is unambiguously rigged to keep the win/lose ratio close to 50% - you could be winning many matches in the row, and then you take a distinct u-turn and go on a losing streak. As time passes, these conditions get gradually worse, since they keep adding abominable cards, mechanics, and other annoying changes. The worst of all - it's Pay-To-Win."
Lerkily,1,2025-09-21 14:50:19,It used to be fun and the items in the game used to be cheap. why does the item increase in value? this makes the game unplayable because of all the p2w player causing this no skill level and evos. im just hoping that your team acknowledge this issue with your game and make it budget to other currency's because that would really be helpful.
OhWayHay,1,2025-08-28 15:36:37,"DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE ACESS TO A CREDIT CARD WITH ALOT OF MONEY. Sure the games fun at first. Strategizing which characters you're going to pick for your deck, but once you have reached a certain amount of trophies, pay to win becomes serious. Card upgrades and evolutions are behind a paywall. If youre free to play, goodluck getting cards for units you actually need for your deck. In this game, the best card is the credit card since skill does not even matter at this point."
Andy,1,2025-08-24 09:12:28,this game is so bad there is so much p2w and it doesn't care about your level you could be level 12 and it would give you a level 15 enemy which is 100% lose and the game play is so bad. The cards in the game are so unbalanced as some cards are rlly good and some are bad. the flash royal person sometimes maybe watches you and they will purposely give you enemies that have hard counter or are just p2w most of the game is bad and I do not recommend this game to anyone as the Devs are money hungry.
Dinush,3,2025-10-23 15:54:31,"The game is good, but the pay to win factor makes it annoying. I understand why the game died about 4 years ago until jynxzi brought it back. if they keep up the pay to win factor, then in like another year, the game is gonna die again. it's unfair if a free to play player gets outmatched by two evolution cards. stop the greed and embrace competition"
Jason Ferguson,1,2025-09-08 02:29:23,"Match making is very poor. Supercell keeps changing the game. Are they trying to completley ruin it? And now it says update, and I go to the play store and the only options are play or uninstall. original post 2021. this is game is overrun with hackers and AI. it is almost unbearable to play anymore. if you dont pay, you wont win."
Edge Papaapa,2,2025-10-02 19:36:47,"Back in 2017 when I first played the game, it was so much fun and strategic. (Can't forget to mention it used to be F2P). But I stopped playing for a little. then I re-installed it and saw so many changes. But that was only the start because now every single game I play has mega nut in it or more no skill. I think you should nerf these spam cards and not log for example. *Never used meg nut and still refuse to add it in my deck!!!"
Scoot1233,5,2025-08-14 07:33:25,"This game is good, however, there could be some minor improvement, such as nerfing boss bandit and other 'fun' cards. Another factor to take into account is the simplicity of the game and new cool features could drastically change the format of the game. Thank you, Yours sincerly Ryley."
David Yurewicz,2,2025-08-14 06:15:55,"Supercell has crafted a steadily-updated, polished mobile game. In a world of mobile slop games, this one's actually well made. That said, it is INSANELY pay to win, and the balance in higher arenas is VERY poorly managed. I have had this game for 9 years (with 85% of it hiatus time) and I find 6500 trophy matches infuriating to play. You'll only ever see 16 of the 120 cards and they'll always be higher level than you cuz they paid for it. if you're gonna try to F2P this like I have, give up."
Cristian Chen,1,2025-10-02 06:39:27,"Worst game I've ever played, it is the most P2W game I've ever played as you need to spend 100 bucks to go against the enemy as they are level 15 and you are barely 11. The timing and placement so annoying as if you miss or misclick you basically lost the entire match from a misclick"
Nulan Kodikarage,4,2025-10-23 12:14:26,"The game is so far really good i made great progress and had great gameplay only problem is that my clash is not working anymore as in its stuck ""opening the game"" and keeps saying errors i hope there is a solution for this but overall its a great game"
Alex,5,2025-10-20 07:00:56,"The Game is EXCELLENT The overall game idea is unique and interesting providing an experience like no other Clash Royale and SUPERCELL did a great job on making the game nd the game is co op and pvp friendly. Two thing that takes away from the game is the ""pay to win"" and the toxicity in each emote which take away from the game experience"
Daniel Talbot,5,2025-10-12 20:40:56,"Needs a little more, but good 2016: Added 2025: The change this game had is brilliant not basic very action packed and it is addictive. A massive change from what I seen in 2016 that is what I like to see, but one thing, you have to pay for a lot of stuff it turned to pay to win; maybe a decrease on the payments but overall a good game."
John Dean,1,2025-10-30 18:25:39,Terrible game So bad full of people who have spent money on troops and so the way you get matched to another player is always too difficult. Progressing through the game is so slow 5 years I have had this and still I am deleting due to hatred of the money making bigwigs
Christopher Watson,1,2025-09-17 08:29:43,"I have been playing for a while now casually from time to time, but through my time of playing it was fine, if I lost it was fair, if I won it was fair, but up to getting into arena 9 (for me at least), nothing about the game is enjoyable and it seems like whenever I manage to win a game, which is barely ever, I get punished for it and verse people with level 12 cards when mine are 9 and 10. It seems the way to win is to just pay, and now it's just not fun."
Kozmo Teehcee,1,2025-08-20 03:44:32,"after all this yrs now i have to edit my review. at this time of the game it's in the worse shape ever with many bugs and little to no care and they keep getting worse, it's a waste of money and time. the trophies after winning won't add up, after a ranked match, it changes mode automatically,etc it's just more broken than ever just close your ""gaming"" studios and go work at McD's ."
Logan Griffin,2,2025-10-01 09:39:33,"This game is fun but after playing for almost 5 years I have realized that clash Royale is extremely money hungry with all of the new offers being added and less and less being added for free to play players it is just making the game completely unfair. Every single time I get a match-up, my opponent always has over leveled cards and towers. If supercell added a skill based matchmaking or added more opportunities for the free to play players to get more progression in the game it would be better"
Tamarie Dunlap,1,2025-10-14 03:43:26,"this game is actually pretty good, until you get over mid-ladder. All I come across is level 15 hog Riders and pekkas when I play. And that isn't even the worst part. This game takes up way too much storage on my phone that every time this game needs an update I have to delete at least 2 other apps just so it can update. This game isn't for the faint of heart and get this game only if you can handle the terrible matchmaking and the constant storage intake"
Kenton Bryant,1,2025-09-28 20:31:18,Terrible. Way too many pay-to-win players. The game never rewards players who do not pay-to-win. The free pass used to be good but the rewards you get are now worthless. Don't play it. If you finish the free pass all you get are 1 star rewards for hours of playing. The matchmaking is also terrible. This game used to be good. Hopefully supercell will actually listen to its game's players
apple UwU,3,2025-10-18 12:31:21,Not bad but very pay to win and very toxic. It does help with mental thinking and problem solving skills but many would argue that its all phone breaking. I personally play chess alot with 2000+ chesscom rating and that makes me learn the game faster and really helps with choices (I win like 80% of my games) I recommend playing chess if you want to improve on clash faster.
Nate,4,2025-10-18 08:49:31,"Really fun game only downside is that if you get on a good winstreak, you play against overleveled players and the game is very pay 2 win. They should update clan wars and add a shop to buy things with medals you earn from it. Also bring back season shop."
Luka Rantalainen,2,2025-10-11 16:51:10,"I've been a long-time fan of the game, but I'm not sure if I want to play it anymore. Everything started from adding elite cards. Since then, every update has made the game more and more P2W: evolutions, reducing free to play progress and making Pass Royale exclusive evolutions intentionally way too overpowered at launch. Also having OP cards locked behind a paywall is pathetic. You clearly have talented people but the ones making the decisions seem to only care about short term financial gain."
Alex Hallett,1,2025-10-07 15:45:29,"I like supercell and their games, most are manageable to play without paying but clash royale is absolutely garbage when it comes to level 14. every lvl 15 is either pay to win or takes a month+ to upgrade 1 card and I'm being generous. you wouldn't think one level would be that big of a difference but it changes the entire match up and games you should win you lose because of it. It is an absolute trash game design made to get u to spend money."
Jacob West,1,2025-10-16 07:53:00,it was fun at the beginning but anyone who wants to be good at the game already knows that mid ladder is impossible because megaknight was already broken before and they made him even better with an evolution so you basically are forced to use him in order to get high up on the trophy road. they need a rework to make the game better.
Earl Jenkins,4,2025-09-03 03:48:53,"Played this game back in '15 for a couple of years, then took a hiatus until about a couple of months ago. My only gripe is that you can easily get up to 500,000 coins, but you can't use them for anything. My other issue is the connection. I have full service whether on wifi or not, and I've lost countless matches because I can't play. Good game, fun game, but if I can't play because of connection issues, then I shouldn't lose trophies."
Zijing,1,2025-10-27 00:44:24,"Originally 1 star, changed to 2 - this game is EXTREMELY pay to win. As long as your opponents pay money and you don't, you are destined to lose. The card levels matters so much that the counters of a certain card can be COUNTERED by that certain card if it is over levelled. TD;LR: No matter how much skill you have, if your opponent pays and you don't, you will lose."
Scarecrow'scrow crow,2,2025-09-30 22:39:34,"GOLD PROBLEM. This game is Great but my only issue is that I had almost half a million if not more then half but I log in one day and all my hold is gone, I qlmsot wanted to quit the game, I tried going support on their website but there is nothing on there at all for that issue it's only selective issues which I think is stupid."
Drake Usher,4,2025-10-25 23:18:51,"After a certain point you go on a horrific losing streak that makes you rage quit. And progressing by just playing becomes very difficult so you end up spending money, but unless you have a lot it doesn't really help you."
Azo1544,1,2025-08-19 20:35:36,"I have around 1000 hours on this game and it's safe to say it's only going downhill. The balance changes that have occurred are absurd and there's no nerfs on cards that are too OP or buffs to underused cards. I understand the game needs funding to keep living but the game isn't about any strategy anymore, it's all about being PAY2WIN, nothing for F2P players... The potential this game has is insane, but Thanks for being a TERRIBLE company Supercell."
William Richmond,2,2025-10-23 16:46:57,"wtaf is merge mode on? cards are randomly drawn sure, but the chances of getting what you need seem to be predetermined before you even start your first match. then when you think you'll be smart and trade in your pieces, the RNG so conveniently decides to draw all the cards you just traded in.... I could setup a bot that would just play, as long as I keep playing my score will always go up... regardless of however many matches I lose."
Mahal Patel,1,2025-10-07 22:32:04,The latest update sucks. I have been playing this for a long time and all my decks were level 14 plus. This 10/6/25 update reset all the cards to level 11... years of playing down the drain. of course if you have any issues good luck getting any support. There is no one there in support.
Hanru Cilliers,1,2025-10-20 14:27:45,"Constant wifi troll signals even when i have full bars and strong wifi and the game is heavy pay to win. The new clan war update is worse than the first with card levels being even more important than ever and you get constantly paired with people with higher tower levels. I lost over 200 trophies due to the wifi troll and after 4 years you would expect them to have decent servers, yet they don't.."
Kevin Kraft,1,2025-09-23 05:26:16,"is a nice game. But after a point, the opponents are far superior. The cards the opponent uses are more advanced than the arena you are currently in. And the opponent seems to have infinite elixir towards the end of the game and they play numerous cards right after one another. Example where the opponent plays 4 cards in a row, including 2 witches. Each witch requires 5 elixir. You can only store a maximum of 10. 2 witches is then 10. Yet the opponent just played cards requiring at least 15."
Rhodes Baillie,2,2025-09-28 18:30:06,The actual gameplay is decent but is extremely unfair. They purposely make you go against players with decks that counter yours and against higher level cards so you lose more and get mad for losing crowns and then play more to try and recover the crowns you lost. It's also pay to win since you can buy stuff to level your cards and have an advantage against players with the same cards. If supercell wasn't so greedy then this would be a good game.
Rick Leach,1,2025-10-25 21:54:05,"Finally made diamond in merge tactics, but the simulated ""bad luck"" and ""good luck"" continues. It's a shame that Supercell feels they have to hold players back for ""engagement purposes"" rather than letting players win or lose based on skill and pure rng, but that's what they do. Once you get through the early stages, be prepared to either win a lot or lose a lot. A good chunk of the games you'll play are entirely out of your control. It's sad because it's a good game when it's real."
Messiah_407,1,2025-08-20 18:39:01,"This game is simply just not enjoyable, it has become a money sucker, is either pay or you don't win. is a shame been playing this game since launch, and sadly i might just have to delete it. there's also a bug if i press battle log to watch the replay the game crashes, come on supercell."
Max Thao,1,2025-09-05 01:01:43,"I'm surprised SuperCell gets any revenue. Who's genuinely playing this game and having fun in any arena after 8? Still allowing overleveled cards in low level arenas, still full of ""micro"" transactions, and it's still holding the horrendously balanced evolutions which are overpriced, AND REQUIRED, if you want to play the game. That in itself is amazing; SuperCell fails so badly as knowing how to handle their own game but it's entirely because of the idiots playing the game that pay into it."
Abdalla Ashraf,1,2025-10-21 12:19:57,"I don't know what's happening. I've been playing this game since it was released on the store, but there's something strange. Every time I play and start winning, when I download a card, it doesn't download and I lose. It's as if there's been a hacker or breach in the game since the last update. Because of this problem, I won't play that game because I've lost a lot."
Sam Sterling,3,2025-09-26 06:09:08,it's fun to play but don't pay for anything. I paid over 30 bucks for this special offer to get a legendary card early (I'm at arena 9 atm) but it only gave me an epic card which I already had. I don't mind paying for cards or chests if I get what they advertised. it was really annoying when I spent all that to get nothing pretty much. game play is really good tho. def recommend to anyone to play. Just don't fall for those special offers they give u. not worth it - won't buy anything more!
GOD GAMER,1,2025-08-25 02:32:11,"My game keeps reconnectting in games and I have very fast fibre so normally games don't reconnect,when I'm battling someone my game reconnects and the other person wins, maybe it's a DoS attack, because I know my fibre does not reconnect me in games at all and I can't get past this arena, worst balancing I've ever seen. I have tried multiple decks, this game is really unbalanced. When they bring out a card they make it OP in the pass and nerf the previous pass evolution like we didn't pay for it"
Teddy danger,1,2025-09-07 02:16:39,"A lower level now somehow beats a higher level of the same troop, thats not how that should work, star leveling only makes your troops take more damage and do less damage. this game is bugged and they havent fixed anything since launch day. i used to love this game and now i cant play it without it making me mad. Supercell please take notes (p.s. somehow i went from 2800 trophies down to 2600 after one loss because of the games issues)"
Eli Smith,4,2025-09-28 22:32:04,"half the games you will lose because of p2w players, but the other half is are skill bases loses because of unfavorable matchups. But when you win and sometimes you lose, you have great games where both sides are equal without hardcounters. and the many modes and monthly updates.Keep the game fresh and interesting. It's really just a problem of overturning. And unfavorable matchups, and make the game worse, not that it could really be fixed fully."
Jakido Marak,1,2025-10-30 23:20:43,I love this game but PLEASE make the matching making better like my opponents will have the same amount of trophies as me BUT Their cards are overleveled and mine are low and that just shows that the games wants you to spend money to level up your cards or just buy it which makes the game really bad
Хуссеін Сафван,3,2025-10-22 02:43:01,"I used to be a Clash Royale player until I started to get those really long chess opening times which is when I quit. Came back to the game 2 weeks ago and it's been very very fun, bravo devs for removing that. Game is less pay to win now. Edit: It is now not less pay to win, it's probably more due to the introduction of evolutions. Stars changing from 5 to 3."
Alexandro Garcia,1,2025-09-23 20:38:09,"Game mechanics favor players who spend money. As you get higher in trophy count it is noticeable that players who spend money (maxed out cards, evolutions) get more points to quickly deploy cards. Even having a deck with low spending does not offset the games favoritism. Overall wouldn't recommend for any new players."
Alex Smith,1,2025-08-25 01:37:48,games fun until you reach higher arenas and after that it's just pay to win. constantly matched against players with cards 2 to 3 levels higher than your own aswell as 1 to 2 tower levels. I've found myself just closing the game when you see higher levels because 9/10 times the games already lost and no matter how you play it doesn't matter because of the level difference. can't recommend playing past the first few arenas
Steven,1,2025-10-08 00:05:36,clash royale players trying to learn a strategy instead of spamming the same easy win card they paid for challenge: impossible. is fun when you find another functional brain in the crowd. however I'd tricky to get to that part of the leaderboard without also mindlessly spamming garbage. I'd give a 0 if I could. litterslly every other game is identical. interesting games are about as rare as a good supercell game these days.
Thomas Glenn,1,2025-10-18 22:56:15,"if you are reading this leave while you still can, it is a shell of what it once was. the early game is a hook to get you to stay but late game is a purgatory to anyone who isnt spending lots of money and needs to touch grass, you could spend hours without a single win, the youtubers make it look easy but it is way harder than they make it look"
Justin Davis,1,2025-10-07 00:05:54,"With all the balancing updates. What you guys should be balancing is pvp matching. The challenges are pointless unless you are on the back end of your lvl. Once you get to the higher lvls there is such an experience gap that 1 lvl is a gigantic different making winning a match impossible. *Edit* Tried to give the game a chance again, but still no balancing for any mode. infact they added a new model Merge Tactics and at a certain point it seems there is zero balance and bots with insane luck"
Jaysen Hildawa,1,2025-10-18 11:45:48,"The game is good. But even though you have good internet connection, there's always an opponent that can release characters thats over 7 elexir but can put down multiple characters. BS!"
Stevie Wonder,1,2025-10-30 00:38:44,"90% of my chests turn into 1 star with 623 gold. My cards need 75000 gold to upgrade. supercell iq = 0. SuperCell is a lazy company. instead of balancing cards, they just nerf the crud of the cards. mega lazy SuperCell Boring and uneventful. You get matched with people who spend money on the game and are at a disadvantage and lose. It's a game for people with low attention span. you get free stuff daily, but only get 1 free card and you need 2000 to upgrade. Just a BORING UNEVENTFUL game"
Alex,1,2025-09-26 03:19:40,"horrible match-up, handicap after winning a couple of games and pay-to-win issues. it’s insane how I have spent a week playing this and I have my cards at level 7 and I get into a match-up with someone that has their king tower 2 levels above mine and cards way more advanced in level because they are matching up a 1 week account with a 4-6 years one. I do not recommend this game if you dislike these kind of match-making."
Luytaris,2,2025-08-22 03:00:26,"Money grab pay to win game, before 2019 the game was balance, the pay to win wasn't an big issue, but right now is just a card game. Not worth the time to play and return after years. Even worse that i had a account linked to this one but supercell deleted it, and never told me that they did that."
R S,1,2025-10-23 11:20:34,"Game match making is obviously rigged to keep you from winning too much, win 5-6 in a row, your next 7 opponents will have the perfect counter to your deck and you'll be lucky to go 5-25.. if this was u.s. owned there would be a class action lawsuit against these theives. how games like this are allowed I don't understand, they even add in emotes to insult other players which will lead players to spend money to try to be better which goes back to rigged matchups.."
Nathan Austin,2,2025-09-15 07:54:20,"Fun and playability for the first few months: amazing. That moment when you work your way up to Legendary Arena and realize that this is just a game of rock-paper-scissors dressed up to look pretty: disappointing. Yes, there's some strategy, but that only happens in about 20% of the matches, when you happen to be well-matched with an opponent. Unfortunately, 4 out of 5 matches you're faced with an imbalanced match-up."
Drey Mansberger,1,2025-09-09 03:48:22,This game is absolutely terrible and pay-to-win. I feel that you should be able to choose any card rather than have to face people who have spent money on this game. The only good modes don't reward you or let you unlock cards making them meaningless. I would rather watch my favorite sports team lose for 8 years straight than play this game.
Shaggy The Sasquatch,1,2025-10-29 05:57:24,at least try to hide the fact that you get benefits with the more money you spend cause the pay to win is so obvious the game is still achievable to get to a high arena but play paying you more then halfs the time it take to lvl up which in retrospect allows you to advance faster so will give this 'strategy game' a 5/10 for actual strategy and then a 2/10 for fair gameplay
Ken Tilley,1,2025-11-02 22:52:48,"Anyone giving this 5 stars is a fake account or a liar. The pay to play aspect isn't even the worst part. 9 out of 10 games I'm losing is because the fill rate of my opponent is different than mine. They get to play 15+ worth of cards in the same amount of time I get to play 6 or 7. It's absolutely ridiculous. Last time I checked the tank can only hold 10, but I guess I can't see theirs...."
Japeth Martinez,2,2025-08-20 11:03:52,"I left for a while and still realize it was a smart choice. After giving this game another chance. Still disappoints. If you PAY, like more than just the mediocre battle pass. You're winning. No point of ""grinding"" when someone can buy cards to max lvl15 and the game giving you no chance of equal play. You may win. But 9k+ is brutal, Gold became much harder to stack up on. Balance matchmaking, increase the gold just to feel there's a chance in this FREE game then maybe just maybe it'll be better"
A Google user,1,2025-10-23 21:56:28,"a game where you always lose! that sounds like fun. this game has died. it's literally impossible to win and there's no way to fix it. bring back ladder. if I lose 100 games in a row, you should put me up against easier players or something. matchmaking is totally and completely broken. developing team should all be sacked"
Timmy Unc,5,2025-10-21 14:21:06,"This is Why we clash!!! This game is peak, I love playing this game on the bus or the train and it is a simple yet skillful game and progressing feels fun and rewarding, the only problem with this game is how pay to win it is because I often verse people with maxed out decks in arena 16 please make it so that you can only but a certain amount of cards and make the cards you can but only the ones from your arena, other than that great game!"
Ian Rosner,4,2025-10-15 23:23:50,"I'm completely free to play and been playing for 2 years and haven't had any problems winning games or leveling up cards and easily got to 15k trophies . So to all those people out there crying about how hard it is to win it really isn't just get better at playing. Overall good game, very fun and addicting but still a challenge to play. Good variety of cards and emotes."
Scrapbot Weaver,1,2025-10-11 00:52:31,"there is no such thing as skill based matchmaking in this game, and it it unfair. I will only have level 12 and 13 cards, and my enemies almost always have level 14 and 15 cards. it makes it impossible to win when you are versing someone whose deck is a higher level than yours. like 1 card and defeat 3 that I place and though normally that 1 would do nothing. And it always puts you against your exact counter deck so there is no way you can do damage to their towers."
Just a unoriginal name,1,2025-11-03 10:21:39,"I've tried to give this game a second chance, every other game past like arena 11 has at least either a P2W or a braindead megaknight / Boss bandit player. This game rewards you for playing no skill cards, since apparently Megaknight is only 7 elixir and can be cycled back way too quickly, every chest no longer gives legendaries, instead just gold and only gold. Do NOT play this game if you want a game based off of making tactical decisions. 0/10, worst mobile game of all time."
Sontlad,1,2025-10-14 17:22:26,"Dogshit game, unbalanced cards, unplayable if you are one level below (14 level cards vs level 15), certains counters don't work if level below, pay to win, not fun. I have been playing this game for 9 years it stills the same experience, impossible to get past 10k trophies if you don't have a level 15 tower and deck"
Mikey Gindhart,1,2025-10-24 03:25:51,Game is honestly terrible now. Everyone either buys someone else's account or spends a fortune in the shop. Game will say connection error only in overtime and when the network is working fine. I would not suggest anyone download this terrible game.
Dan Miller,1,2025-08-24 08:43:22,"Look, I like the game and have been playing a long time.... on & off 9 yrs. With that being said, it has really turned into a pay to win! The dev. team is all about the dollars they can get. They nerf things into the ground or completely change how something works without fixing or countering things that have been ridiculous for yrs. For example I have 2 accounts and 60% run Mega Knight variations. None of the spells have a counter (Freeze countered by heat for example)! It's sad now!!"
Ethan Levoir,1,2025-09-17 00:33:25,This game is so pay-to-win and unbalanced. U can pay to max out your cards as soon as you want whenever you want. and if you don't want to pay money. You have to wait years to even get one card maxed. The unbalanced part comes in when they decide to come out with a new evolution and make it completely overpowered the first month then completely nerf it to the ground after that so supercell can get its money. They dont care about their players anymore and its all about the money. dont play this.
Zachary Fuller,1,2025-10-19 03:03:55,update this game is the most pay to win twisted piece of garbage on the market. these guys definitely get their advice from blizzard. I have 9 years in this game and I'm still probably less than top 50% because you can just boost your cards to max by spending money and there's really no limiting it. Then there's the hackers...... this greedy corporation is incapable of making a good game for people it will always be about profits first.
First name,4,2025-10-24 08:00:03,"has this game changed over the years? yes. for the better? surely not. is supercell yet another major, money-hungry, service-slashing corporation hellbent on worsening and bastardising their games to increase profit? yup! but, i will say that i still find profound and unadulterated pleasure in playing this game while on a few milligrams of high quality (R isomer) ketamine! i highly recommend it to any aficionados out there looking for a playful and quiet way to spend their night/high. :^)"
Steven Stevens,2,2025-10-22 08:43:13,this game is good but is way too pay to win. not to mention the matchups you get in certain situations are either really easy to win or impossible to win. it's also clear they keep you in a certain arena on purpose. I'm in arena 12 and I went on a winning streak before getting right to the last game before arena 13 just to go on a losing streak. it makes me think its rigged
Dave Bohmier,1,2025-11-02 21:24:12,"game is terrible for f2p players. do not expect to get far without spending mass amounts of money to unlock stuff without having to play. also look up the meta decks and pretty much only get familiar with those, any variantion of a homebrew type deck just doesn't stand a chance against anything in the ladders"
Ken Graham,1,2025-10-21 18:42:05,"the game dictates how you win or lose if you spend money it lets you climb if not the game keeps you low, my level 15 troops and king are getting beat by level 13 troops, dont waste your time on the game SuperCell are getting greedy trying to get you to spend more money the game is generally to hard now and you cant move up the table anymore"
Bogdan Botnari,3,2025-10-04 23:05:20,"I have been playing for around 2 months and i have reached arena 16 as a free to play, at the moment i am very hard stuck in this arena due to players spending money on the game , dont get me wrong its ok having an advantage by paying but sometimes its too much , please make the game more balanced and enjoyable for everyone ."
Kavya Mertiya,1,2025-09-17 19:35:56,"Clash Royale used to be a fun, skill-based game, but now it feels like it’s all about money. Evolution cards and pay-to-win mechanics have made it too easy for players who spend, while free players struggle to compete. Matches feel unfair and boring because strategy and skill don’t matter as much anymore. So I am deleting this game thank you"
TFTK,1,2025-08-18 14:54:38,mmmmm ok the trophy system is still bad but the game is fun. I still dont see y we lose more then u gain and have to win like 2 or 3 times just to get back to were u are. i take back my last statement its not that fun now that people are just buying the cards and power leveling them to close to max and using them in the lower floors kinda annoying..
DavyMaybeWavy,2,2025-09-19 22:55:23,"The gameplay is fun BUT who wins is decided at match start around 40% of the time if someone bought cards and evolutions you just simply lose, it's often about pay to win rather than skill or strategy, if they paid to have better tower level and unit level there isn't much you can strategize to win there just stronger, really frustrating to play against that, also with the new arena changes if you weren't playing before the changes the people at your trophy level have cards you can't get"
Elias,1,2025-08-19 02:28:38,"Extremely pay to win, unplayable at this stage. Unless you spend a bunch of money you are always gonna be beat by some toddler who spent 30 bucks on the game it takes 8000 hours to get to half the lvl and evolution cards as someone who spends money on the game. The best clash royale player could NEVER beat someone who has 3-4 lvls on him on every troop."
Tyler Blow,3,2025-08-19 23:34:26,"WARNING, PAY TO WIN. Fun game when you first start but once you get in the higher arenas you need to pay money to keep up with other people's cards lvl 9 vs lvl 11 every other game. Also matchmaking is rigged to fix your win rate at 50% ,so as long as you avoid the trophy road and just play classic 1v1s once you unlock some cards, it can be fun."
Edward Windle,1,2025-09-02 10:51:34,"I used to think this games only issue was its match making. however, now that im in the final arena, I now realize that's only early to mid game. late game, it's just a plain old balancing issue. Yes, they can be countered, but only if whatever overpowered card is on the field is the only one. the moment they play even one more no matter how weak its game over unless you're using the exact same strategy and if that's the case, then what's the point."
Reaper Fletchley,4,2025-09-29 22:29:32,"It's a good game, probably the best of its kind out there. However, the development process leaves a lot to be desired. In spite of appearances, they do not cater to the majority of their players. They leave in concepts that have been functionally removed (like trading tokens). The thing I've seen the most upheaval about (season shop), which was incredibly free to play friendly, has been removed in favour of a paid season pass that costs as much as a PC game every month. capitalism 🙄🙄"
Noah Javier,4,2025-09-13 16:14:57,"This is a really great game. It's so fun and I can play with my friends. But kne thing about this game is matchmaking. For example, I'm in arena 13 and havent unlocked mega knight and havent been able to upgrade a lot of my cards. HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO WIN WHEN I HAVEN'T EVEN UNLOCKED THE CARD OR UPGRADED IT? I really think you need to fix this, as it just makes the game pay to win and unfair"
allam toffaha,1,2025-08-23 15:56:08,"I lost all my progress due to not connecting it with the supercell id 3 years ago. I didn't do that because I thought connecting the game to my Gmail account is enough, now I tried to recover my progress and the support keeps telling me to contact them through the supercell id that is connected to the account! like I'm telling you I don't have one that's why I lost the progress, anyway they said they couldn't confirm it's me although I provided all the details they asked for. so bad service😡😡"
Theodore Baza-Bohnert,4,2025-09-10 11:38:41,"Fun but evos are expensive and the game requires alot of grinding if you want to level up your cards at all without spending any money. Evolutions are $10 each, and some of them are really important for certain decks, especially if you play a cycle deck. Really fun, but if you tilt its so painful because its alot of pressure not to tilt further, but that might just be me. Im at 6.5k trophies so im only a bit experienced."
Marijus Turčinas,2,2025-09-18 21:53:40,"This game is completely rigged. When I put a goblin tower, no one attacks it. Idk if this is a glitch or not but it's very unfair bc it's one of the cards I use the most. It has also kind of just turned into a money sucking game. They will do anything to get some more money instead of making the game more enjoyable."
Kevin Giboney,1,2025-09-13 13:28:24,"I used to love this game. However, the state of the game balance has been completely ruined. Because of this, games often feel frustrating as getting the most powerful aspect of the game right now, evolutions, is nearly impossible f2p. I would not recommend, 3/10."
Andrew Turgeon,1,2025-10-18 09:47:48,"This game has all the makings of a good game, yet manages to fail in any possible aspect of enjoyment. It very obviously forces you into situations which are unwinnanble, and gives an overwhelming advantage to those who are willing to spend ridiculous amounts of money on this worthless game. Overall, this game has great potential, yet still manages to offer among the worst gameplay I have ever had the misfortune of experiencing, and anyone who gives money to this game should be ashamed."
Zayden McCalister,4,2025-11-02 16:27:58,"this game is so fun!! but there needs to be something down about the pay to win players, I get Supercell needs to make money and keep ad free, however the game gets really frustrating when your level ten going against players with near max level troops."
Nahsani Mack,2,2025-10-30 07:45:57,"I have been playing this game for years, since it first came out to be honest but whenever I do return to play this game or even brawl stars.(since this issue is apparent on both for some reason) The issue is that when I type in my gmail for the code the code is never sent regardless of which device or gmail I use."
Nono,1,2025-11-01 21:04:07,"This game is so bad,anytime you are about to get into another arena they put bots that have all your counters and it's genuinely so frustrating. Please just let us get to the next arena we already put the work in to get to the top of it so stop taking away from the achievement."
Oz n Roll,1,2025-10-10 02:18:36,"Literally has become the most toxic phone game ever. Not to mention seeing the same decks over and over again. ""Let's add masteries. Maybe the players will switch decks."" Hahahaha 6 years, it's time to uninstall. (2023) The review above is from 2 years ago when I deleted the game. I installed it back 3 days ago, and guess what? IT IS AGAIN UNINSTALLED FROM MY DEVICE.🤣 Imagine 2 years of updates to give me literally the same experience, again. TRASH."
ARMIN Nateghian,2,2025-09-05 19:53:45,"I've been playing this game for almost eight years now, and I enjoyed it until you started to add countless of useless characters and features like the evolution thing, which wasn't necessary at all. You tend to always introduce new things, which actually ruined the simplicity and fun of the game now..."
Mani Kanta,1,2025-10-11 22:09:57,"Nowadays it's becoming one of the worst games, worst modes and worst game play and statistics also. I think the developers have made these while they are drunk.. how can it be soo ridiculous, in merge tactics particularly in one game they kept that meging will give random troops in that I already have 4star troop suddenly it became 2star troop when the game is started. if you are not able to fix the please don't give updates like this."
Jesse,1,2025-09-16 08:09:02,"coming back after a long break. It's improved in some ways but worse in others. The smaller elixir cards are disbalanced, so nearly every opponent you fight has the same deck that they probably found on YouTube. It's extremely ptw now as well. if someone spends money, you won't win. They are also offering a tournament. however, you have to have a small fortune invested to even consider it. They also have bots that will counter any deck you make if you get too many trophies."
Firas Husseiny,1,2025-09-26 21:17:04,"absolutely dogshit support team. My account was hacked over a month ago, and for some reason, it seems impossible to contact a human for support. I tried in-game support and waited 2 weeks for a response only for my convo to be closed. I tried through support ticket only for them to tell me to contact in-game support. So im basically stuck in a loop of bots and copy-paste message and not a single actual human who cares about my issue."
D TL,1,2025-10-07 23:06:04,Used to be rated 5 stars many years ago but recently had to change due to absolutely no help coming from the team. My account was hacked and they changed all of my info so I try and go through their channels of using the bot that never works then they say try the bot again before we can help then they just never respond back. This has been a several month ongoing issue. I have spent good money on this game over the years and have now lost everything due to no one even responding and chats closin
Joshua “Ice” Aquino,4,2025-07-30 13:09:11,"This is that ""hate it, love it"" type of game. Despite its P2W nature, the game is incredible; from animations, graphics, and to its unique characters and features. It's hard to grind the game but with the right deck for each arena that matches your play style, the game can be fun. Though I do suggest that you don't grind it extensively to avoid being bored or stressed if your on a lose streak. Overall a 7/10 game. It's good, but can be better."
Rishie,4,2025-10-27 11:52:18,"clash royale is not working 😭😭. I tried to login but it stays on the same login interface, despite having a perfect connection it into 75% after 1-2mins the game opens and then inside the game it's loading or buffering idk but I'm not able to play the game..."
Gabor TV,3,2025-08-20 02:07:16,"Game is great on it's own, but the pay to win aspect ruins any competitiveness of this game. They keep adding levels to soak up more money, and now with evos it's even worse. Apart from that people are spamming 3 decks all the time, honestly just play merge royale, unless you have a lot of cash with nothing better to spend it on."
alan healey,1,2025-09-18 17:51:07,"Seem to be playing a load of bots, a mixture of around 5 decks, the game as gone very boring. Been playing for about 9 years. All my decks have been maxed for ages. Instead of creating banners and so on, create more to the collection of decks. spent loads don't get you anywhere. this app is gone 😡"
Khayber Nadeem,1,2025-10-18 05:15:46,"worst worst I hope supercell sees my review. I did about 35 matches and I was going back and forth from 7451 to 7421. I don't know who ever is sitting behind the computers, please don't be idiots please I deserve it because the player's tower level and troop level is not the same as other players they are very high."
Saveliy Ryabokon,4,2025-09-20 09:54:34,"They have to fix merge tactics!!! It's so unfair. some rounds you get exactly the troops you need and other rounds you get troops that are totally different and don't fit with your team. I understand that you can change the team and that is the purpose, but how can I be sure I'll get the right troops if I'll make that change? Also they need to add a modifier that allows the team size to be 15, or at least greater than 6 and 7."
Kayden,3,2025-08-29 03:24:25,"it's a fun game, the only reason why im rating it 3 stars is because of the amount of pay to win players there are. most of my cards are level 11-13, and then I'd be versing people with lvl 14 and 15 cards with a lvl 14 king tower. and not only that, if you want to beat those pay to win players you'd need to spend lots and lots of money. The game just isn't balanced enough"
Mark Coates,2,2025-10-08 20:58:34,"Just not fun anymore. Pay to win all day. Everyone has the ability to buy legendary cards so once you get high enough, every battle is the same cards over and over and over. clearly gives an advantage to those who spend money on it, the cards you get are not ""random"" as they claim, and when you bring a legitimate issue up to the support, they shoot it down without actually reading the complaint."
Dominic Ducusin,4,2025-10-26 01:44:17,"This game is really fun to play, and it makes a lot of great experiences. If youre really bored, I would highly suggest you download this game. The only thing I dislike is there's so many microtransactions and the matchmaking isn't as balanced as you'd expect (i.e. I played against 5 overpowered people in a row). other than that, really good game!"
Paniz,1,2025-11-04 14:43:16,"Hahaha my account was suddenly deleted a few hours ago and when I came back into the game it brought me back to the training stage... It was a waste of time, thanks Supercell for reminding me why I don't like your pay to win games!"
Silas,1,2025-09-14 20:35:33,"This game could be amazing, but it’s pure Pay2Win. Evolutions take months for F2P, while whales have them maxed instantly. Matchmaking is unfair, rewards are tiny, and the shop is just a giant wall of overpriced packs with fake “free rewards” as a psychological trick. Skill doesn’t matter, only money – worst mobile game ever."
Leo Yang,4,2025-10-17 02:31:00,"The gameplay is something unique, fun, strategic, interactive. The progression system is not as good, many parts of the game is pay to win, which can only be worked around with a lo tof skill."
Finnegan Glancey,1,2025-11-03 23:32:28,"Somehow worse than the last time I played. Evo cards place a clear divide between those with and those without. Unless you are willing to pay for them, or grind through months of having a clear disadvantage, or just accept that you aren't playing to win, this game isn't for you. Especially if you are a returning player having to face other higher-level players with these evolutions. Pay-to-win. I can't in good conscience recommend this game to anybody."
Gloria,1,2025-10-31 10:29:43,make the game offline instead it's way better I only like playing games that help me play both on offline and on line and stop making the loading screen always stop at 75% finish it's annoying because my wifi is always on and off stop making it go from 25% to 75% later just go straight like 0% to 100% few secends later
Jasper Zhang,1,2025-10-18 22:25:47,"actually a horrible game. the balancing sucks, it's almost impossible to get out of midladder, it's so pay to win and almost forces all players to pay if they want to get out of like arena 3. overall one of the worst mobile games I've ever played. if you're thinking of getting it, please don't its just a waste of time and makes you so angry for no reason."
Contact Bottle,1,2025-10-12 22:52:04,"It's pretty fun and addicting when you start getting into it, but sometimes the matches are too easy as If' they aren't even real people. After maybe 6k trophies the matchmaking is constantly screwing you over and you see these overleveled player and you just wanna stop playing but you can't since it's addicting and you've gone too far to stop so you either get a second job to pay for it or it becomes your second job. summary: pay to win,time consuming , addictive( bad) , worst matchmaking"
Muhammad Huzaifa Jamshaid,3,2025-09-01 23:05:55,"WORST GAME ever👎. In last 3-4 Years This game becomes PAY TO WIN💸, and it's very FRUSTRATING and IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN😡. Developers and concerned should try to balance the game by giving EXTRA TROPHIES and EXTRA Rewards to those Players which don't spend money (or unable to pay because of financial condition). When you loose a game then you loose 30-33 trophies🏆which is very important for making progress in game. And when you win a game you gain only 30 trophies🏆rather than 33 (which you lost)."
Neo Ganteng,2,2025-10-14 22:13:29,"The game is quite exciting, but this should have been thought about from the start. If the signal is bad, a warning should be given before the match so that we can anticipate and avoid defeatnwhile playing in the middle of the game, Even though at the start of the game the signal was good, why did it suddenly lag in the middle of the game? and i hate mega knight"
Harry Partridge,1,2025-10-17 16:09:32,it has been annoying as when I play i could win mabey one or two gamse then I have like a 10 game streak of losses then all the progress I try to make is gone and it is just pay to win I could loud into a fair game then the next one will have like 90 more crowns than me and they have all there cards maxed level it is just annoying and I just can't make any progress in this dam game don't download this game it is just pay to win the matchmaking system is terrible u can't make progress don't play
Joshua Scott (YMiD1UNV),1,2025-11-05 00:33:09,"Start recording your games with Screen Record or a Camera (I'm using GoPro) because, i strongly believe that they slow down your Mana Regeneration. I was recently playing & stared at my Cards for awhile &, saw it moving Slow, then Speeding up to Normal Speed numerous times... Aslo, if the Bots NEED you to lose... you WILL lose. Don't even think about a 5-10-15 Game winning streak (now that we have Ai... is it being used here?)🤔"
Zawad Zamil,2,2025-10-30 15:06:49,I mostly play this game in my launch break. But most of the time I find maintainence break. This is so annoying and it takes far more time than they commit. Also the loading time is very high when I play it on mobile network.
Dan Ivinson,1,2025-11-02 19:24:27,"Loads of clan names that are racist and pedophile based but supercell aren't interested in safe play, that's why you can't contact them anymore in the game. The match making is rigged so you lose. I've spoken to agents and they have admitted they know the matchmaking is not fair. There are so many glitches but they are not interested in fixing them. Supercell are just happy to take your money. It's just a scam. Don't bother with the app and don't pay to win."
UNKNOWN NAME,1,2025-10-05 22:47:29,"I've been playing it since 2019, I'm over 10k now, but recently whenever I play clan war everytime I see technical glitch, it's becoming irritating now, especially when you get level 15 king towers as opponents every time when you are level 14 yourself, plus the coins distribution is horrible, I've been stuck in level 14 since forever"
Abdullah Shaffi,1,2025-08-23 21:44:53,so the new merge tactics sucks. it keeps going to connecting even tho my internet is working fine. i don't get it why your QA team is not taking their job seriously and launching this buggy merge tactics mode. You've been updating for quite some time but this is really absurd. whenever I am winning your bug keeps popping up and i can't play anymore. FIX THISSSS
James,4,2025-09-09 05:58:32,"Great game, I have been playing for a few years and I am in legendary league after a bit of work. The only thing I would say is that it is pay to win so if you spend money you have a better chance of beating people that havent. Edit - Very p2w nowadays but fixed the game from the last couple years, much better now and working up arenas is fun."
OG Hustler,1,2025-09-01 00:06:38,"changing my review to a one star. would give 0 stars if I could. since update, the game will be stuck on the loading screen when launching the app. then it gets to 75% and gets stuck on updating when there isnt an update for it. a big gaming company and they cant even fix their app. im not the only one experiencing this"
Michael Lenhardt,1,2025-10-13 21:52:42,"This game is so badly balanced that it's only fun for a while. Eventually, it's an absolute joke. In merge mode, I'm up against people with advanced rulers and level 15 cards!!! Most of my cards are only level 8 and 9. In what universe are those idiots in my low-level leagues? You guys suck at balancing a game. Mechanics are wonky and inconsistent. Sometimes one of your troops in merge mode will do random things to lose the round for no reason. What works one round fails miserably the next."
H O K,2,2025-09-27 00:54:37,"cool game in the beginning, but try to increase your arena, on this point the game is literally trash, you gonna face a higher rank players with better cards and towers, at some points the game feel like give you some wins and then take'em back just to stay on the game more for a longer time. hope to fix this matching problems after more than 5 years from release."
Closing EX,2,2025-08-18 11:07:50,"Matchmaking is not random. 90% of opponents will counter your deck. Change decks, you will play against counters. Severely narrows the experience. Every prize and upgrade has an extremely long animation, that can not be skipped. Slooow progress. 2yrs, playing every day to max 1 deck, if you pull the right cards."
Aidan LaManna,2,2025-09-21 04:55:01,the game is fun in all and Ive only played the game for a little bit and I've already gotten to the point we're I'm almost at area a 8 and fighting max level cards and just a pay to win game I have nothing more wrong with it because it's just pay to win all the time just fighting people who have less skill level but just card difference. a few days ago to test my friend he plays the game all the time and pays and his cousin who has played the game a little longer than me lost to me got destroyed
Neil French,1,2025-10-17 13:21:05,"Very addictive, but you'll find yourself out-gunned all of the time. Not sure why it doesn't match you up against someone at your level. Occasionally you'll win and think great but you won't win 5% of the time. Very frustrating. This game is the poster child for Pay to Win... it's pathetic, but if you don't pay, you can't win. It's a shame because it could have been a great game..."
Prabhat,1,2025-08-31 21:12:55,Game was fine for 4-5 days I was playing it then all of a sudden now I am stuck at the loading screen at the updating phase where after 5 mins it just says can't login retry and I am stuck at this cycle. This game also has severe network issue which causes me to lose trophies .
Joseph McCloskey,1,2025-08-22 02:03:18,used to love playing this game so much as a way to chill out or kill some time. Was an avid player of the ranked (path of champions) mode but now that's been locked behind a wall (15000 trophies). It's so obvious with level 15 evos and now this mode being locked that supercell are greed personified. (good luck with reaching 15k trophies as you will be facing against cash whales who spend their entire paycheck on this game)
Konstantinos Loumos,2,2025-08-29 03:18:28,"I'm 8,5k trophies playing for 2 hours total and lost 200 trophies. overleverd pay to win people. no progress system on free to play. removed season shop because ""it wasn't popular"" the person with the most money wins. it's sad the game I played for 4 years Chases money after making 23 mil in one month. hope the fix something up"
Clint Eastwood,3,2025-08-14 01:38:54,"Was a great game, but not as good as it once was. It's become complex with gimmicks and sparkle bling everywhere. Prize inflation is terrible. I spend almost as much time on clicking prizes as playing it seems. It takes time to build your teams, it can be done for free much faster than when I had to do it. UPDATE: WOW! Now play seems to refelct players ability verses maintaining CRs desired win rates. Waiting for adjustments to happen..."
Shumon Haider,1,2025-10-09 18:30:15,"Remove pay to win, if you want to add cosmetics go ahead, battle pass, go ahead. But what the flip is a magic coin and book of cards because I spent 5$ the main core of the game is strategic, but when I'm fighting level 9 with level 13 cards it doesn't seem to fair, zap and many other cards tickle them"
Oscar Martinez O'Connell,2,2025-08-15 03:45:44,"This game has potential to be an amazing game and its popularity shows that. But it shouldn't be popular at all. the amount of pay gaps that there are in this game are absolutely ridiculous. Supercell (the creators) do not listen to the fans, the fact that you can get some of the strongest cards in the games for just a little bit of money. Clash Royale went from a great, friendly, fun game to a disgusting cash grab that rarely care for their game.The start of the game is the only enjoyable part"
Calvin Updyke,5,2025-10-04 00:45:45,"Clash Royale is the best mobile game out there. It's the perfect mix of strategy, quick thinking, and fun. Every battle feels unique because it's not just about strong cards but how you play them. I love experimenting with different decks, and the updates always keep things fresh. Climbing the ranks is thrilling, and even losses help me improve. Plus, being in a clan and working with friends makes the game even better. I can easily say Clash Royale is my favorite game ever."
Thamindu Pradeera,3,2025-10-22 18:46:05,"This is a good game. I have been playing this game since 2020.But i noticed some times when in a top arena or level (At least silent sanctury), we are matching with mod players or matching with the players who are has a very high level.Its verry annoying thing in this game.Sometimes, I feel an elixer filling bar is more speed in opponent than ours and a lot of times our oppenent deck seems to be an antideck for our deck and always matching with such a players in a row for a few😔😒"
Troy Anderson,5,2025-10-26 04:49:44,"it's an amazing game, I love how many characters you can choose from to add to your deck, I like the concept of having clans and trading/requesting cards, I like how the game works and how smooth it plays, it loads everything really fast, I like how you can play all types of different clashes with friends, overall I don't see anything wrong with this game whatsoever, amazing. 10/10"
Ethan Howe,1,2025-10-07 11:02:10,recently there's been a lag when placing cards down during a battle which has gotten more and more annoying as I keep playing. It has caused me to lose several battles. hopefully it'll get fixed but for now the lag is pretty bad. reinstalling doesn't work either
Ezra J,1,2025-10-11 16:15:26,"Honestly, it feels like im playing because im addicted and not because the game is fun anymore. The game was amazing in the beginning, but over time, i feel like it got worse. Majority of the time I'm playing against what feels like three decks with a couple of cards that variate from time to time. They made it impossible to grow at the same pace as players who pay. The matchmaking has to be situational. It has become a completely defensive game, which makes it much less fun than it used to be."
Devansh Sharma,1,2025-10-28 19:28:47,"SUPERCELL's biggest Pay 2 Win game ! The wars are ridiculous where most of the time, we have to face higher lvl players. Don't expect much from Evolutions, they are just a new source of income for this game...Broken Cards and Broken Evos are launched to gain money on the name of """"EARLY ACCESS"""". Meanwhile nerfed by the time it becomes available for free."
Juan “JC1Gaming” Campos,3,2025-08-20 04:48:14,"I loved this game still pretty fun, but they keep changing characters which either makes or breaks you. recently they changed the furnace which has BROKEN ME I've been playing with a specific deck and I've worked on it for many yrs. just for them to change the furnace and for what?! my deck has carried me and now I have to restart from scratch and decided which charters work best for me again. JUST STOP BRING BACK THE OLD FURNACE."
Justin Cervantes,2,2025-10-16 01:19:38,"I love playing but honestly the matchmaking for this is an absolute joke. I've worked hard to max out my deck just to get trashed by someone who's paid to have higher level cards at a low level or low play time compared to myself. Unless you want to spend money, hard work means nothing here anymore"
Reagan Smith,1,2025-09-30 02:46:44,"it's fun in the beginning, but as you go up further, it gets more competitive. even if you change a card, the game will place with someone who knows how to counter you. it's easy to pay to win, and the bridge just is too small. It makes every game feel the same win or lose. party mode is the only fun one."
Ark Surge,1,2025-09-27 23:59:48,"game isn't fun to play. there are no guard rails to save you from playing against people with way stronger decks. you can't surrender to save yourself time or frustration. sometimes you only win 1 in 4 games. some people are so down bad to win, that even after you go afk, they will sit there, shaking in fear, floating elixir, scared that you will surprise combo them, so they will play very slowly and just run the time out, even though you already left and quit. very often the game is torture"
Sandy Cummings,3,2025-10-28 08:16:29,"It would be a lot more fun to play if it didn't take what seems like forever for the elixir to fill up! I get too aggravated waiting on the ""fill-ups""! It is fun to play, but if you are short on patience like me, I don't recommend playing this game!"
Kaden,1,2025-09-16 22:11:20,Climbing areans was literally one of the the worst experiences I've ever had in gaming. Not really much fun to play anymore and I dunno what's up with all the in-app purchases. Also the matchmaking is rigged (look it up if you don't believe me) which ruins the flow of the game.
Wyatt Page,2,2025-10-07 20:58:23,"This game use to be so fun but now it's only the same decks people use and it's been like that for years. ""Balance changes"" but they don't change the decks tht need it most. if everyone uses princes cycle or hog cycle, might be something wrong with it. doesn't take a genius but ig this devs just don't care tht much. Don't rec to play anymore until they can actually make real balance changes."
Soren Black,4,2025-09-09 23:18:43,"some arenas have so many bots that it's unplayable. while others have only real players. but when you get the bots, they win 80% the time. everyone always is spending money on this cashgrab of a game, and I can't say I haven't either cause I have but not to the degree of some folks."
Adrian Vargas,3,2025-09-15 02:59:28,"The game is cool in all,no ads,online, competitive.But one thing I hate is when an opponent has higher level cards than me. I can't stand that,it's very annoying too. Supercell took away the chests,and I don't have most of the cards. So please,supercell please fix the game and card levels. There are times where my opponent is in a higher league than me,Also it's pay to win so no wonder it's harder for ones like myself."
Abdulla Alremeithi (Spartan4k),1,2025-09-25 09:01:48,"for F2P players, this game is unplayable. match after match you'll be against high level cards and EVOS, I recently got back to the game, and now I know why I deleted it the first time. purely just there to get your money. a single emote can reach 10 dollars. for one evolution of your choice is more than 10 dollars. game is filled with desperate kids who needs to win to cope."
Ehsan Osanloy,5,2025-10-28 14:09:36,The game is awesome nearly every card can get some insane interactions and progress is so fun in the early game. It can get P2W at times as most items can be bought and some arenas can be a pain to beat but updates are great and more evo shards please supercell
Koch,1,2025-09-01 10:30:37,"My husband asked me to play this game with him. It took 151 matches of Clash Royale to reach tower level 8 which is required to play 2v2. Roughly ten hours of my time invested playing boring matches. At first, the players were unskilled and our decks were evenly matched, fair enough. Then it starts trying to manipulate me, advertising battle passes and chests while matching me against players with cards three or four levels outpacing my own. I hate this, man. I miss paying for games upfront."
Owen,3,2025-10-20 04:52:13,"it is a very fun and entertaining game the only thing I dont like is well it is very, very, very, very, very etc... paw to win unfortunately that is the case for all supercell games. They make such a good and fun game and decide to ruin the fun with money. I hate it, really. but other than that, it's a really fun game now. been here since the start."
Ahmed Salah,1,2025-10-13 08:03:15,"I have no clue what you did with the latest updates, but the game keeps crashing over and over again. It's not about ram or network or storage . even before that started the pay to win thing, which really frustrated me to the point where I would delete the whole thing permanently. ."
Desmond Miles,1,2025-08-28 19:18:36,"great game, but it seems supercell has problems with Iranians. i can't log in the game, i can't log in supercell store, when I do log in the game and enter the battle, if i manage to get in the battle before 2:54 in time, it'll completely freeze the game and it'll unfreeze around 2:20. it seems supercell has some serious problems with Iranians."
Lexi Hai,1,2025-10-08 05:15:39,"This game is such a money hungry game. They overpower cards, so it's not fair for others to play. They do this since people will pay to win and get better cards. Also, they never fix the issues in game like prince. Please Supercell fix your game and make things fair. Finally it's not fair to be playing against levels higher than you and I think you should fix that too, thanks."
Nitro,1,2025-10-27 16:50:45,I've been playing this game on and off for around 7 years and I know they have been killing the game slowly but this latest update removed the only non p2w way to play the game and still progress. it's a shame because this was a great game. but the Devs are terrible people. you can also tell that they pay for fog reviews too make the game seem better then it is new edit: don't play this game. you'll just be miserable now
Brendan,1,2025-08-29 17:08:18,"After playing for 3-4 years I have a very big perception of the game. If you don't use whatever is the ""thing, meta, etc."" you'll get beatdown to the point of demoralizatoon after thinking you can play with something you created on your own. it doesn't matter what level you are. once 15 hits. you have to play meta or your done. cooked. sautéed. doesn't matter. it's 1 out of 10 decks to choose. Mk, recruits,bloon, doesn't matter. whatever royaleapi has everyone is gonna copy it. Nerf boss bandit"
Liam Gardner,1,2025-11-01 11:52:53,"This game is THE definition of annoying, I can't stand all the toxic players, p2w-ers and and how LONG it takes to progress, not to mention the INSANE amount of shop offers. It hurts to see that this game is related to Clash Of Clans. Clash Of Clans brings me so much joy, while this just makes me upset. Please fix ur game SuperCell, for all of our sakes."
Ratan Gohil,5,2025-10-30 16:10:15,The game is very gud and addictive but it is P2W game but it is not that big of a problem. People are complaining abt P2W thing bcuz they cannot win while being a F2P player. I am currently in Arena 16 and it only took me 1 yr. People r just bad and cannot win that is why they r giving the excuse of the being P2W. Yes at a limit it a P2W but it is not that bad of a game. It's just the skill requirement is high and not the money in the bank account.
Alicia,1,2025-11-04 20:18:38,"you're a greedy company. I love the new spells you've added into this game, but I miss the old clash royale where you win games by strategy and not money. this game has become trash from all the pay-to-win stuff. I like the evo things, they're fun, but maybe queue somebody with evo cards against another person with evo cards. I've been stuck in one arena because every single person I fight has higher lever cards + evo, it makes it super unbalanced and there's nothing I can do. fix your game."
Tiffany Gómez,1,2025-07-22 08:42:13,"The game is super boring now (I have played for 9 years. It was one of my favourite games to play). People play with the same deck over and over and over and over. For example, if I play 10 matches, at least 8 or 9 people have the same deck, and it gets again boring and exhausting to play. I am at 8000+ trophies, and the game has gotten unbearable to play. It has lost its essence for real."
Bryce Morningstar,4,2025-09-21 01:09:03,"Honestly it's a fun game especially with the new update with the alternative game where you have the slots to put your selected cards in the area but I've had this problem at least on android where after a while of having it downloaded, it'll have a problem where it's loading after tapping the game and then goes to 25% and then to 75% and stays like that forever even after closing and opening the app several times"
Te Huia,2,2025-09-04 15:15:39,"it's so utterly miserable to play. it's incredibly pay-2-win and is extremely toxic. People can pay to get high leveled troops and will just destroy you. the only reason this isn't a 1 star review is because the gameplay is fun, it's just that the pay-2-win and toxicity make it unbearable to play."
James Corvino,3,2025-09-05 20:17:30,"New merge tactics mode is dumb. giving away evos basically. was trying to make it to 10 years played, but I fear that won't happen. Every time I think to increase my rating I'm reminded why it's low. However it increased because of the duration of play. one mistake can cost you the game."
Ben,5,2025-10-31 07:09:01,"To start off, I love the graphics. it does great matching you with other players that are around your combat prowess. The 1v1s are insane, you don't really have to use your brain much, because you fingers get muscle memory from placing the correct troops in the correct places. But, one thing you guys could change is the amount of trophies you get or lose from winning or losing battles. like, if you don't destroy any of the enemies towers, you lose less trophies. Win more if you destroy all twrs"
Draven Hollywood,3,2025-08-28 01:57:34,the game is extremely fun but it's also obvious how pay to win it is I can't attach a picture but for 17 dollars in my country you can get 1 evo 25 lucky boxes 4 legendary card 90 epic 270 rare 1125 common and and a bunch of other things. I still haven't spent money on the game and as I climb the arenas you notice more people who have clearly spent money on the game. summary: it's fun but disappointing how a little bit of money can make you a lot better then someone who plays for hours a day
Brandon Tingen,4,2025-10-26 05:59:09,"it's really fun. and I've played it for probably 50+ hours and there is only 1 issue for me the matches don't give you random opponents. well sort of the higher you get the more noticeable it is. matches are tailored to your deck you can get matching decks, decks you counter or decks that counter you 60% of the time it's the 3rd one I played 4 matches in a row and it was the same deck with or 2 different cards that were mostly just cycle cards."
Rico Suave,1,2025-10-04 09:13:16,Horrible. The game pits you against opponents that are way overpowered due to pay to win. The reset for the game is 24 hours. You get nothing but coin for the majority of the chests. It takes soooooo many cards just to level up and when the chests drop nothing but coin its not worth your time what so ever.
Owen Thomas,1,2025-10-18 19:40:23,horribly set up to pay and win. will once higher levels it will consistently give you opponents that you cant beat. levels and multiple characters over my levels... definitely should beca game removed for basically trapping people to spend money
Kev B,2,2025-08-26 00:18:53,it's not a bad game you'll hit a wall somewhere between 4000-6000 trophies mine was 5400 depending on your skill level and this is when the game starts to become P2W it just isn't fun going against decks where every one your opponents cards are 1-3 levels higher than any card in my entire collection. You'll get some fun out of the game but once you hit the wall you have to spend money or wait months to make any meaningful progress. You can't really have multiple decks without P2W
Adrian,1,2025-10-13 08:50:22,"worst game, it was a good game before they made it pay to win, you find yourself out gunned when you can't place troops as fast as your opponent, the game is unplayable 90% of the time as players pay for items in-game to outlevel you by miles, the game is even addictive enough, adding pay in-game objects made It annoying and stupidly easily while other players can't achieve them that fast while other players press 1-tap and get Evo so fast while you are struggling to get a Evo shard"
Noah Horn,1,2025-09-12 11:05:15,"the game is HORRIBLE the game will not let you progress in certain areas without spending money, sure you get loot boxes and rewards but not even close enough to level up cards let alone dare and try to play a new deck. if you try to step out and not play a meta deck you lose, you try and play a meta deck but cookie ther all your cards were spent on last week's 'meta' decks. so in the end you can't win without spending money on the most over price mobile game EVER."
Lance Hier,1,2025-10-18 17:59:16,"like everybody say, it's a P2W game. You won't even be able to win when you're free to play, it's very hard and it's braindead they'll js spam an over leveled card and boom you'll spam your whole deck to defend and js be shocked there's another over leveled card being put on. it's not a fun game anymore it became a money sucking one. can't even strategize because it's braindead"
james mckinley,1,2025-09-24 10:58:51,its only fun when ur starting out... you play spend money because ur having fun and having a bit of a challenge while ur playing... then u get paired with unbeatable decks over and over until a new day begins and it will give u 4 games ull be able to win without gaining too many trophies... dont waste ur time or money on this game... if I could put zero stars i would... I dont know why I keep giving this game a chance
Maxi C,1,2025-10-06 04:50:57,"This game is pay to win, you need to buy a lot of levels just so you can play regularly, and there is still other stuff like evos you have to buy just so you have a chance of winning. Most of the time I play trophy there king tower and cards are overleved. Most pay to win game ever"
Collin Rogers,2,2025-10-06 22:22:39,"Game has clear rigging. The premise is fun itself, but you're often paired against bots, and those bots have decks that are specifically designed to counter yours. To make matters worse, as of recent, I've noticed an insane elixir generation difference between me and the bots, where they get to deploy troops ~30-40% faster. It's a joke, and it's obvious once you start looking for it."
Moana Daniels,1,2025-10-24 23:47:23,"I rated it 5 stars last time, but after getting people that counter my deck i just couldn't handle it. I was in a 5 row win streak and only need one win till the next arena, suddenly i just kept getting people that countery deck. I hope its just a bug but this just isnt ok Edit: Ok i was just reallyyyyyy overdramatic, I like the game again Edit: on second thought this deserves less than a 1."
Merman hunster,2,2025-09-02 16:35:00,They remove your emotes and sell them back to you.Nothing has changed for the last 6 years apart from about 3 cards. Any long term players are unable to upgrade any cards therefore rendering any card achievements usless. edit: a couple of years on and the game has been pushed so far in a negative direction there is no where else to go. if you've played from day one it probably has just become a game to play in the odd spare bit of free time. no achievements to be having for us
ICEMANABZ (Silverknight),2,2025-11-04 01:56:01,"although game got better...matchmaking is still abysmal, at level 13 tower i expect other lvl 13 towers, but no constantly getting bulldozed by lvl 14 with maxed out units is never fun. Shame matchmaking is still a big issue. Update: cane back after a year or so...fun till you hit those players with evolutions and no way for you to get them ingame. disappointed"
snstale123,4,2025-09-21 17:19:17,"I'd give it 5 star if it wasn't so pay to win based. thing is I might just be bad but I cannot get past the jungle arena at all. its like everytime I play the game my team is put up against a hard counter. my account is approximately 6 years old right now. even got a card that is available in the next arena because of it, and yet I still struggle. Amazing game i love it but really needs to balance things out from the pay to win and the normal."
Elliot Watson Football,5,2025-10-31 20:14:57,"I had seen this game in ads for a while and didnt think much of it until i was bored one day and thought i would try it out, I LOVED IT SO MUCHHHH!!! It is so fun i love being able to get better and get new cards and evolve them to the max level overall i would really recomend it to kids age 8 and above hope this helps. My favourite gane ever!!!!"
macky c.w,1,2025-10-26 21:19:03,"it's fun at first then they only put you against the same type of deck to force a loss, I fought the same deck with just three characters changed about 12 times in a row, I still won some but fighting the same deck everytime is tiring and needs to change."
Liam Crockett,4,2025-09-23 22:28:06,"Im lowing my score down to 4 because of all the new, confusing updates they have released. I liked how simple it was like 2 years ago when the team system wasnt hard to keep up with. Overall still a fun game to play, although hard to keep up with if you quit playing for a month."
Calvin,1,2025-10-12 18:40:14,"what is the reason to not let people report? I was just playing a challenge and went against someone that was most definitely lag switching, lack of no wifi symbol, just delay placement by the perfect amount during pushes, sitting right next to my router. my question is why can't I do something about it if your terrible system most definitely won't? Please fix this supercell."
Gabriel Tan,1,2025-09-09 19:56:36,"honestly this game is bad, I'm not sure why people like this game, this game was okay at first, but once you reach a certain amount of trophies, this game just throws you into a game where you cannot win at all, plus there is a chance you might go up against pay to win people and they have better characters and cards , there is almost no way your winning against them, if they wanna make this game pay to win which is so unfair,this game overall is BAD"
M,1,2025-08-28 12:41:25,"I'm not giving any stars until this matchmaking is fixed,clan and ranked matches should not be against people who are not in clans,as well,when trying to progress in trophy road,you matchmake us with people and or fake accounts that intentionally win to keep us where we're at and one level above us who are also at the minimum for next level but won't demote/lose trophies on a loss but we do smh **make an easier way to report players for using bots/cheating/spamming**"
Zachary Tierney,1,2025-10-03 23:12:35,"Severely declined in quality over the years. The game is so blatantly pay-to-win now that it's ridiculous. They got rid of the loot crate system for daily rewards that used to be a pretty flexible way to manage your rewards from playing. They replaced it with a system that will only reward you for winning three battles in a day. So the only incentive to continue playing the game is a thrice-a-day handout that most likely contains cards you already have? Message received, Supercell 👌"
Joey Bryce,2,2025-09-03 05:29:52,"Sadly this game has become pay to win, lately i have been goin up against level 10 cards that are 4 arenas away. And funny enough im am only getting gold from my lucky drops, the only way i can upgrade my cards without spending irl money is by buying cards in the store with ingame currency. Its very hard to enjoy this game if your not willing to empty your bank account for it."
Daily Awesome Player,3,2025-08-13 15:53:58,This game is an amazing concept. But the balancing is horrendous. still possible to play with meta decks though. It is fun though but starting out free to play is hard. you basically have to commit to a deck if you ever want to even the playing field (card levels) at mid/high level. So there's not much room for switching your deck around in ranked/ trophy road. The meta changes frequently and it's usually what the new broken card is before it gets nerfed. 7/10 fun could be way better
Prizmac y,3,2025-09-16 00:12:37,"Clash Royale is a very fun and addictive game. There are just a few things I have a problem with. this game is extremely p2w. I'll have games going up against level 15 cards while my average is still 11. I don't agree with some of the things supercell has done. like the shop being taken, chest getting removed, And some of these buffs and needs that they add are ridiculous. but other than those concerns the game is truly fun and you can meet some great people on the game through there clan system"
Hako ugur,3,2025-09-16 23:07:38,"This game might be the most pay to win game in the world. They developed a wonderful game type in which strategy is needed but they ruined this masterpiece with unfair p2w advantages. Extremely overpowered cards occur in my opponents deck even though those cards are unlocked at much higher arenas. Entire game is shaped around purchasing new cards, boosts etc."
Yanick Will,1,2025-10-03 22:56:02,"This game is just p2w (pay to win), it's also not really fun to play as f2p (free to play) because you are more than likely to go against the same decks over and over again with the some cards being different. they made a different game less p2w as this game got more popular again. There's so much micro transactions that even EMOTES costs 6€."
Ryan Olsen,1,2025-09-14 19:52:41,"My 1st mistake was to think this is pvp. It isn't. It's pve and pay to win until you're winning, when the difficulty will miraculously increase until you pay more. Ever notice in merge tactics where it immediately shows the winner, even if you purposely lose first? the other 3 should still be playing to determine their order. except none of them are real players. Don't fall for their garbage and save yourself the time. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. supercell is no different than scammers."
Angel Matos,1,2025-09-08 05:03:35,"unbalanced and not scaled correctly makes PVP a nuisance. The devs don't care and mock you in the tips. I am convinced after 5+ years of playing that they integrate bots that will automatically counter any card you have in your deck so you can't go on 5+ win streaks, not to mention you lose more trophies than you get from winning, making it even harder to excel. The only good thing to do is play the classic modes so you don't 'stress' when your whole deck is conveniently countered."
Aiden Lacomb,1,2025-08-19 20:16:19,"Its so p2w, how come I'm facing someone with an arena 12 card when I'm only in arena 10. And why are all of their cards 11 and plus. And if you take a look at the shop, you can quite literally get every card in the game, from champs to commons, even power them all up to 11. Im not saying don't make money, but atleast give f2p players something to work with. Not have them spend money on the game just to win more. Spending money on the game is fun at first, but when time moves on, its just boring"
A S,1,2025-10-27 23:17:45,"I used to rate this game 5* but it has been completely ruined by greed. The core game is great but supercell constantly makes the game worse for non-whales. At this point the game is trash, they clearly only want to abuse addicts willing to spend absurd amounts of money to compete."
tashn,1,2025-10-10 06:06:44,"been playing this game since 2016 but there's no progression if you don't spend money, it use to be good in the sense that anybody could become the best it didn't matter if you would spend money or not but theres literally no progression if you don't spend money. I'll most likely quit this game."
Noah Bergen,1,2025-08-14 12:39:51,This is such a terrible excuse of a game its absolutely insane I don't know why I can't stop playing it but it is an abomination of a pay to win game. I have spent over 200 dollars on this game and then right after about 600 trophys of gain if I havnt spent anymore money it's impossible to move up and I will stay at same trophys for months. I'm currently at 8200 trophys and I am playing almost 3 hours a day and I havnt moved a single trophy in 5 weeks of consistent play. It's ridiculous.
Draco 06,1,2025-08-28 23:27:52,"the game is good but merge tactics just isn't it. The gamemode is based on pure luck and requires zero skill. sometimes you are close to getting a three or four star card, to then just sell everything and get nothing. I like playing the game, but this game mode needs some work"
Aaditya Vaidya,1,2025-08-30 13:56:51,"This game is very addicting at first. However, when i kept playing and advancing arenas, i started to realise the algorithm of this game. Whenever I am just a win away from the next arena, I get put up against a more skilled opponent and then end up on a losing streak, then aim to come back and win again then advance to the next arena resulting in me playing more games. This game is purposefully designed to frustrate you and make you eventually pay to win and advance or quit."
Nomar Zamora,1,2025-09-05 06:33:48,"Supercell's recent game design choices and actions display CLEARLY that they no longer care about player enjoyment and instead only care about the user's wallet contents. I have made the mistake of misclicking the pass royale icon. CR proceeds to autocharge my account $12 without an ""are you sure?"" response. In addition Supercell utilizes a strict no refund policy and makes it nigh impossible to contact them. Sad to see a used to be good company stop caring."
Sebastien Escalona (EskoBlazin),1,2025-10-28 23:52:42,"You have the nerve to put bans on players even after they've spent money on the game? nah. thats too much. there's a reason many of us fell off this game years ago. pay to win. you actually have the nerve to charge 80 plus for something that will only upgrade 2 cards at most, and not give you an entire game like a normal market. the banning for players leaving is the icing on the cake. the company has gotten too greedy. dont waste your time."
Aarya Rane,1,2025-10-24 15:38:00,"worst game in the gaming history. shame on such a big gaming company like supercell cant even manage games properly. The game loses network in the middle of a crucial match , i was playing my finals in my college tournament where this happened due to which I eventually lost the finals. Many players have complained about this issue but the management is busy updating and promoting some stupid ideas.Many old players like me have started to lose interest cuz of this issue. #stopthisbullshit game"
River Williams,3,2025-09-16 04:30:31,"if it didnt constantly ""lose"" service in the middle of a game play! it would be much better. It definitely feels like everytime I'm in the middle of a game it ""loses"" internet. I've played this game for year and enjoy it but this bug is definitely annoyingly aggravating!"
Jamin Bokilis,1,2025-09-11 11:59:23,"I have played the game for about 5 years now and am trying my best to stay positive while doing so. As of 2025 more players have started playing the game and seeing this supercell have been maximizing the amount of money they can get out of players, some of my reasons include the posting of broken evolutions along with broken cards the problem with that is that is what determines the meta and what top ladder is going to look like this leads to f2p players like myself verse these decks non stop."
RAFI BASHAR,1,2025-09-21 23:46:21,"I downloaded the game a few days and loaded up my old account and I was enjoying game for some time until the game stopped loading. It is stuck at 75% in the loading screen, and as far as I know (from reddit) there is no fix to this. Supercell please fix it."
Zackary Wille,1,2025-10-08 23:22:16,"this game is terrible I play every day and all I play are people with higher leveled troops no matter what im at 6.780 trophies and the only way to get your cards significantly higher levels like everyones elses at this point, now spending money is the only way for me to get my cards as high as there's this is a pay to win trap game only way to be good is spend money, unfair game to everyone who can't spend money on it"
Jamie Brizendine,2,2025-10-13 06:05:51,"Lowering my rating. Game is fun. I highly recommend skipping the upgraded pass. 12 bucks to get low level drops on the paid side is just not worth it. play the game, skip the pass. it really doesn't add anything of value. I can't count the number of 1-2 star chests. But it's been the vast majority."
John FromSoft,1,2025-10-12 22:05:21,"It's alright till you get to higher arenas, then it's pay-to-win slop. Enemies have cards you can't even get in your arena, can't go back to previous arenas either, so it's not like they got kicked down the ladder. You pretty much have to pay for evolutions because you get only 3/6 shards for free (for a character they choose), if they decide to slap them in for you. It's unenjoyable, and doesn't even provide incentive to spend money at that. Why would I when the enemy always has it but better?"
Tommy Chan,1,2025-08-16 14:24:54,"I've played this game for a long time, and I just logged back on after a long time gone. What ha changed? Well, nothing that good. They gave one of the already most powerful cards (mega knight) a game breaking Evo and it still isn't balanced, along with making it harder for free 2 play players to progress. Seems like the devs are out just for money now."
Todd Baker,3,2025-09-03 06:36:51,"I'm leaving this review because I've seen the direction the company has taken. It's now official that they are fully in the pay to play space. I only keep playing because I've invested so much time (and money) in the game over the years. I have a 9 yr badge and when I began if you grinded it out I could upgrade any card. Now good luck if you want that new card or play in ranked 15,000 crowns - really? New players stay way, at least that's my advice."
Myles Wharton,1,2025-10-30 18:17:56,"I started playing this game and was enjoying it but seam after a month goes straight back to unfair matches, dont bother down loading you get paired against all level 14 and above and all have evolution all takes to match you with someone who has the same evolution as the other person to make fair, for example the war match to day am in 7000 trophies and they were on 10000 rocking full team of level 15 and am on 12, only in silver war"
Saurav Neupane,1,2025-10-02 00:00:01,"Just wanted to report that merge tactics new version is too laggy, especially while changing the cards after we select or try to move the cards quickly. happened after new update despite good connection, tried reinstalling and installing again! I'll definitely look forward to it!"
Bowie Ulinski,1,2025-10-20 13:01:24,"too many p2w players, toxic players, and can't get cards without paying $11+(yes I'm talking about evos). overall fun to play with friends but losing 10 times in a row bc ppl spent money to make their cards extremely overpowered is not enjoyable. supercell ik you guys want more money but your gonna lose more players as time goes by."
Annabelle,2,2025-09-27 18:16:43,"After 4 years of playing, my opinion remains unchanged. Your wins become more and MORE reliant on RNG the higher up you go. Past 6k trophies, you have to just BEG that your opponents deck doesn't have something that completely outclasses yours. Skill becomes less favourable higher up and you simply need to be lucky."
Anthony Franco,3,2025-08-14 22:02:04,"Over time, the game has gotten more pay-to-win methods. However, the game is very fun to play with friends. The cards you choose will determine if you win or lose. Climb the ranks and become a champion of trophies.(update) The game is pay-to-win. And every time I press play again I want it to stay on the same mode I chose instead of having to switch it back and forth after each match."
Natalia Elena chioreanu,2,2025-10-04 08:57:32,"The game is a fun enjoyable fighting game but sometimes its unfair as you level up arenas you can find commonly players that bought stronger cards than you or etc. Honestly its annoying because they can spam it too if the elixir went two times faster at the end of the battle if someone still didnt win, makes you loose your patience with them. As you level up arenas you will find them more and loose your crowns. I understand that the game makes profit from that but its annoying."
Scot Verbs,3,2025-10-26 03:13:25,"Been playing for few years now. loved it, hated it. updates have taken away from the game, the shop going was one of the worst, but the daily challenge going was a good one. I play longer now. without the shop, can't get Evo shards, and advance your deck very well. you have little conroll over what characters you can advance now. most of my deck is flashing green. no incentive to level up card not in decks. but want my deck level 15. can't tho. also can't play. up date. too big. need 3+gig? wow!"
Aiden Dunkley,2,2025-09-04 07:06:05,"I love this game. It is truly one of the best skill based games out there. However, Supercell has not been making very good choices over the past few months. Removing chests, removing the season shop, adding the vine spell and new Evolutions that completely break the game until they are nerfed into the ground, but not nerfing cards like prince that have needed a nerf for years are some examples. All of these changes just made it harder for free to play players to keep playing. Justice for f2p!"
Meldri Guerrero,1,2025-08-16 00:14:39,"Good. But for some reason, it deleted my account update. on August 15 2025. this game is just broken. In a sense that you are matched with players who have clearly paid for this game. with level 14 cards while you have level 11 cards. Royale, I know everything is about money. but, God damn. also, the developer are smart, not adding an option to message your opponent and let them know of the huge mismatched it was."
Pankaj Sharma,3,2025-09-29 21:29:15,Well its been 9 years since i started playing this game by SUPERCELL. Its obviously my favorite time pass ✅❤️ But over the years this game is becoming more and more money oriented. You pay money you get evolutions and cards and everything. But i still love it. And its the best one ever created by SUPERCELL.
Adam,1,2025-09-16 01:58:31,"Its a very fun game but some of the evo cards are just so game breaking its crazy. edit 1: Evo cards are mostly pay to win at this point too, since they aren't in crates or the shop. edit 2: sorry, just cant keep playing with evos since they're both game breaking and almost entirely pay to win. If it takes months to get 1 evo without paying real money for it, it's just gonna drive people away. I still win a lot it's just every time i see an evo I like the game less."
Cody Smith,2,2025-10-10 06:29:38,i really love this game on mobile but and im pretty good on mobile. i made a new acc so i could play at the begining again and its litterally impossible/ the game decides when u rank up as i should not loose to people on arena 1 with my skill and they are still really good for no reason. they made it so you need to spend money. now for the pc issue. it doesnt stop crashing and theres literally nothing wrong it just closes on my pc and it happens to many others. fix your game supercell please.
Zichen Zhan,2,2025-10-28 03:14:50,"a good game if it wasn't paid, like you can't play if you don't have money! it's not fair that I have lvl 11 cards while the enemy has lvl 14/15 cards and insulting me, the cards aren't even balanced, because if it's new then it's broken if it's old it's likely weak"
duddits s,2,2025-09-22 10:19:16,"pretty much a tycoon. and if your really good, you will just go against people who are better at 1 point so you keep having to play and slow your progress from reaching your goal. don't be fooled, it takes skill but sbmm just makes it a PVP tycoon. pretty much clash of clans just with the PVP part being the focus. wouldn't suggest it if it's was something you wanted to progress based on mostly skill like 6siege, chess, checkers, apex, u get it. take for face value . a mobile distraction but fun"
Enla Latenda,1,2025-10-15 21:27:50,"Terrible experience, clearly pay to play rewards get smaller every season then they release a 'balance' but ignore the fact that some card are horribly overpowered like Mega knight, wizard, and the tower but are happy to nerf cards that were just average. If you are thinking about playing this game be prepared to pay or lose, you might advance at a snails pace and it might feel like progress but understand they are controlling that snails pace progress. Do better Supercell!"
Ravishankar,1,2025-08-23 16:49:56,"This game no longer gives importance to player experience. If people pay, they are given overpowered characters that will roll over non paying users. In short, this game is no longer the balanced game that it was when it started. If you are poor, then don't even think of fun games."
Chad Scott,4,2025-08-14 00:01:09,"please change character ai. I shouldn't have to click on one, to check its stats then completely exit out and click on another to do the same. please make a way to click on one stats, and swipe on the top of screen to switch to the next. It takes a lot of time just to find good decks that way"
Caleb Bowman,1,2025-10-08 11:45:10,"This game is really fun at first, but the more you level up, the more its pay to win. Shame on the developers. The evo versions for $10 a piece makes it completely unfair to anyone who doesn't want to pay for a stupid mobile game. Definition of pay to win"
nieto,2,2025-09-27 21:27:45,"I love this game if I'm playing it on anything other than PC! It crashes almost every time I start a battle which absolutely sucks for my rank. It also has the worst performance of almost any game I've played, even with good WiFi."
Ross Forbes,1,2025-08-18 17:03:32,"I have played since the start and the gameplay is amazing but the game is let down by the very defensive nature of the game. This has not been addressed by lowering tower damage leaking elixir needs to cause damage to towers but not active king. Also repetitive decks are a problem that needs fixing, by higher frequency stats adjustment. Also evolutions are just a pay to win as they always come out far too strong B4 getting nerfed a few months later. Clan wars 2 should be scrapped it never worked"
Koholint,1,2025-11-01 19:07:41,"2v2 matchmaking is horrible 9 times outta 10, my teammate is either nonexistent or just plays randomly. You're forced to sit and watch the whole match instead of just leaving the game or else you have to wait a whole hour cause of some dumb ""penalty"". Game is a ragebait sim."
Jontán Muñoz,2,2025-10-02 10:25:43,"shame to see one of my childhood games turned out like this. all the changes aren't even bad I actually like them, its the matchmaking and the subtle ways it trys to force you to spend money. beautiful game just create some form of matchmaking and it would return to it's former glory (I just lost 5 games in a row to pay to win over leveled players)"
Sayan Biswas,1,2025-09-24 14:06:53,"Its now a pay to win game i have been playing this game for 6 years now i havent spent any money and i cant see the difference people with same level same tower level have cards with max level while im stuck at 11 or 12 i've been stuck at one arena for a month and im frustrated , skill dont matter here all that matters is how much you spent on this game . Im probably never gonna play this game again Thanks Supercell for ruining another beloved game of mine"
Saim S. Rashid,4,2025-10-07 02:12:59,"Even though this game is currently going through some hatred yet I love it so much. This game offers you combination of strategy and excitement. Each match feels different. But after all I only have one request for supercell to restart the season shop, coz it was back then our source of leveling up in our own way as we could buy what we need according to our wish. For no season shop, Events have become really unenjoyable and boring."
Noel Tan,1,2025-09-30 22:19:11,"It's good. But there are some overleveled players, annoying players , and players using non skilled decks. Another thing the trophies system is bad. For example you lost to an overleveled player guess what you lose 32 but when you win you gain like 28. And the last part is when you keep loosing it gives you a player that has no clan so ussualy its a bot."
Doubra Timbuodo,3,2025-11-03 19:04:05,"The games great, its got good graphics and features, but there are a few flaws to it. for example the season shop got ditched and ladder is way to annoying. The matchmaking in ladder is always against you when your gonna get to a new arena. Also the amount of overleveled players is insane, for e.g im in miners mine and some people have already gotten lvl 14 cards. All in all, its goodd but could use a few reworks."
Miry Padron,1,2025-10-11 03:45:48,"i am free to play OG, then I took a break but when i revisited, it seems this game just wants to suck every last penny out of my bank account. clash is a fun game, but it is getting way too pay to win. when I want to unlock an evo the free to play way, I need to play for 6 months. If I want to cook in my arena I have to pay. MAKE FREE TO PLAY EXPERIENCE BETTER!"
pozem,1,2025-10-02 02:53:55,"After installing the latest update my game crashes after 5 seconds of opening the app, even if I don't click anything (if I would then it would crash even faster), I've tried reinstalling because at first I thought that maybe it corrupted or something but it seems to just be something with the update"
Th3Gam3rGuY,1,2025-10-28 01:41:22,"Clash Royale is a very fun game to play to pass the time, and i havent even spent a cent on this game and i still enjoy it. But the matchmaking is absolutely unfair, you get paired up with someone who has a way higher arena card than you and it makes the game unfair to you. Its a pay to win and the card balancing system is unfair to most players. People shouldn't be able to get high arena cards when the players themselves are in arena 2. This game is unfair."
Tradan Alexander,1,2025-08-20 02:23:18,"This game is extremely pay to win. The matmaking is also terrible, placing you against opponents that are 2-3 levels above you, which incentiveses spending money and creates an endless cycle. Also, the servers are terrible and have extreme amounts of latency. Please do not install this game."
Marcus Gutierrez,3,2025-09-18 05:26:31,"this game is beyond repair. you switch up your deck and automatically go against your hard counter, and when you take away cards, you go against decks you should have beat with the cards you just took out.. Not to mention the waves of bots they will put you against. coincidentally, all of them will be your hard counter. The game always seems to have some type of broken mechanics. either cant process what to attack or hits wont register. it use to be fun but now its annoying"
Garrett,1,2025-09-30 03:42:55,"Not only is this game extremely unfair and pay to win, but I'm getting really tired of these frequent 1-5GB updates. I don't have that kind of storage on my phone. Last update I had to delete several apps and other applications. And now I have to do it again (made this review a few years ago... the game is even more pay to win now and updated about 30 more times. I've had to delete THOUSANDS of pictures and videos and hundreds of apps just to keep updating this atrocious game)"
Ari,4,2025-08-27 05:05:42,"I think this is a great game, but there are a few issues. For starters, progression can take a while. Free 2 play people like me suffer through a ton of wins after losses after wins after losses, etc. I've been stuck at arena 7 for 5 WEEKS, but I just got out. But I can see why this can just be contributed to me being bad, so this game gets 4 Stars. Also, buff evo wizard."
Cailyn Smit,2,2025-10-24 14:37:59,"I really enjoy the game, but every morning when I try to play, it’s always down for “maintenance.” It feels like there’s more time spent on maintenance than on actually playing. Please look into improving this."
Austin Frederick,1,2025-09-22 03:25:10,Don't bother playing this game if you don't want to spend. it is so pay to win at this point. Wasn't bad a while ago but now it's unplayable. Can't even play the game really without paying cause every game you go into has someone who just dropped $100 on it for the new evolution. or for 5000 epic cards to upgrade everything and then don't even bother trying after champions are involved someone drops $8 to $9 dollars per champion card and then boom nothing you can do. the game was fun but not now
Juan Ayon,1,2025-10-27 02:22:51,"Most people are toxic and it just ruins the game. getting beaten and some of your crowns are taken away And them spamming the emote it just makes things worse plus They should really fix the fact that they should probably not say she probably stopped. But for me, you should probably stop with me if you lose you. Get some more trophies taken away. Because it could get really annoying and sometimes lead to uninstallments."
Joonas Mitt,4,2025-11-05 03:03:57,amazing game but it is overall heavily p2w in the early game. late game gold is scarce and almost everything revolves around levels which can make winning difficult and thus also gaining gold rather hard.
Gabe Deaver,1,2025-09-19 05:35:12,"listen, I have been playing this game since 2018, and it has had its ups and downs. However, one thing that hasn't changed is the rigging. You can truly be the best let's say hog player in the world, but you will get matched up with megaknight and mini pekka 10 times in a row, like me. It is just unexeptable but I understand why they do it. Supercell is the greediest company on the market right now and I don't believe that will change for a while.I suggest playing until 6k trophies then quitting"
Pxylza,1,2025-09-20 19:41:42,"I get excited to play, I lose to a p2w or unfair matchup, my day gets worse. It's a constant cycle. My decks are consistently 2-3 levels lower than my opponents every single game, in clan wars it's genuinely impossible to win anything because of this. I levelled up to level 12 princess tower and now I face level 13s. It makes 0 sense. It feels like the game gives you horrible overlevelled matchups every single meaningful game, and you can't progress whatsoever because of it unless you pay."
Rohan Naveed,2,2025-09-20 03:13:14,"I have always enjoyed playing clash royale, been playing it for more than 6 years Just changed my phone and installed it on my new device but the game gets stuck on loading 75% or ""updating"" written in loading bar Also shows connection error after a long wait on the stuck screen, even if my internet connection is good and is able to run all other supercell games perfectly Please see to it whats wrong and fix this."
Caleb Grant,4,2025-10-16 07:46:27,"I absolutely love this game. I have been playing for a little over 3 months and I have been thoroughly impressed. The game mechanics are well thought out. The only thing is the paying. It makes it people in lower arenas have a harder time winning matches because these pay to play people swoop in and destroy my tower with a evolution baby dragon. It could lead people to quiting. My suggestion is to have two different matchmakings. One for people who pay, and one for people for free."
Liam,5,2025-10-23 00:25:04,"The brilliance of Clash Royale begins with its intuitive core gameplay. The objective is elegantly straightforward: destroy more of your opponent's towers than they destroy of yours within a limited time. Players simply drag and drop cards to deploy troops, spells, and buildings. This low barrier to entry ensures that newcomers can jump into the action without a steep learning curve, making the game instantly understandable. Ps, i used ai"
ethan stapleton,1,2025-10-29 19:16:18,"the games pay to win, I cant get anywhere without the game hinting at me making a micro transaction,and the game freezes up alot or doesn't let you place cards, you can't even get evo shards in the shop anymore without using real moeny, not to mention you could be fighting players with cards way higher level then yours, fix your game powercell"
Neji Chukhu,1,2025-10-12 21:57:15,The game keeps crashing mid match in my PC. After it crashes once I can't even start it again. The google playstore says it's optimized for PC but then I don't get why it keeps exiting the game itself every time I try to play it in my PC.
Jawahar Vijay,2,2025-10-21 14:16:11,I have been playing merge tactics bt still the game doesn't support for players who didn't pay for the pass royale wantedly the trophies are being reduced by the games algorithm when compared to players who pay for the pass this is utterly sad to players who have been playing for years no respect to players who are playing this game for more than 6 years
Brandon-Lee De Caires,1,2025-10-01 23:37:38,The game has honestly taken such a horrible turn... pay to win and super unbalanced unless you swipe card. game used to be good in the beginning but completely adopted the flex your bank account play style very sad to see. if you have mega knight in your deck like 90% of the rest of the players do you should be able to tank pretty much most cards because the people that balance this game have no clue what balancing means.
Woody,1,2025-10-16 19:53:57,List down my questions👇 play 3 seasons passes to lv 90 just to get a guaranteed evolution? opponents always levels above you? tokens don't work for the people who don't pay? always bad updates and op new evolutions? why creating tactics mode in clash royale to? The only thing i would actually appreciate is a new mode with all cards no Evolutions whatsoever and can only use princess as tower. therefore maybe i consider it an actual gameplay.
George D,3,2025-10-12 02:34:44,"This game is good except once you get to 5k crowns you start to go against people who are way over leveled. I'm at 6500 crowns with level 10 characters and I'm going against level 14 evolution characters with a king tower 2 level above my own. it's so outrageously pay to win that the pop ups are unavoidable, supercell have made it so impeccably hard to not pay to win it is a shame and it reminds me of another game that had the same issue ending with most of its players leaving. Disappointing."
Fortypayload123,1,2025-10-16 07:54:48,"Update for Loser was made by losers, not for losers. Still true months later... (also working really hard to delete those 1 star reviews). More pay to win than ever, level 15 = 2 evos... This game is trash man, don't bother playing. F2P is in the worst state its ever been. They year is 2025. over leveled Mega knight and hog rider are still the only thing you see. Boring ah game."
Ultranightmare Doom,1,2025-09-08 05:09:30,"game buckshot, once in arena 4 it becomes impossible to get trophies because the bots and actual people it puts you against have more trophies than you, as well as better cards to always counter it. Over all game now sucks, used to be good, don't recommend, unless you like to crash out."
Steve G,1,2025-09-08 14:43:58,"Data deleted due to inactivity which I accept and its part of t and c (although i did not reveive an email saying it would be deleted as it states) but I had hundreds of hours and paid real money into game which I have receipts for, I asked support if they can do anything to aid my rebuilding or give me a welcome back bonus I have accepted the lose of my original account but all I got every time was just an automated response, just shows supercell dont care about individual members"
Kevin Stawicki,1,2025-09-07 02:14:28,The game is just really hard to make progress. This game makes me feel like you have to spend money just to win. Everything I do the enemy just counters. I always get put up against people that actually pay money and can't even have equal fights.
Omar Ehab,4,2025-10-02 18:53:58,"i have one simple request, can you PLEASE make updating the game optional ? you see, i play clash royale on an old samsung phone and updates take a lot of space for me because mu phone doesn't have that much space and the things i can delete to make space are games that i have important save files one, so can you please make updates optional ? it can be bad for someone to lose their progres cuz they forgot to make a supercell ID and i don't think i've money to get a new phone. please do it :)"
Vimg,1,2025-09-26 21:43:32,"later into the game it's extremely pay to win and after winning about three to four times you will always get a match against someone playing a counter deck, or over leveled cards, so you just get slammed, and they suck really bad at balancing the game, releasing over powered cards then nerfing them a month later after people buy them, free to play is a absolute slog find a different game"
Ricardo,1,2025-09-19 15:23:34,"PAY TO WIN. I get destroyed playing people with higher lvl cards. It's absurd. Is it too much to ask to play someone my lvl cards or EVEN CLOSE? With 10 minute matchmaking you would think matchups. would be better. This is the definition of pay to win. If i can tell the guy has max cards, why can't your algorithms?its a simple "">"". Learn to code. This is daily. Do you even read these? After more of the same, this will stay 1 star forever, even future updates. Enjoy it, jerks. 1 star ratings: x22"
Trev P (Andre),1,2025-10-17 08:06:35,". trashhhh. trashhhhh. NERF every good player and a half second slow for elixir and drop time, if you don't pay.. TRASHHHHH TRASHHHHHHHH!! Been playing for years and dealt with the changes but now.. Straight trash 🗑 they nerf every player, Elixir is much slower. Seems like people who actually pay have the advantage every time now."
Rishaan Sharma,4,2025-10-24 03:04:51,"The game has fairly improved in a couple of months and is really fun to play, though the only setbacks are difficulty in maxing a card to level 15 and the game being in favor of p2w for fast progression...."
Dokie Col,1,2025-09-28 21:26:06,If you pay 12 bucks for Pass Royale then you instantly win the game. It's unfair when my opponent plays a level 14 prince in Arena 12. The game is in a state where nothing is balanced at this point. We only get a couple of lucky drops then the game just stops giving as if they don't want us to play for more the old version was way better but just needed tweaking. The game is a shell of the amazing game it used to be. Please for the love of god nerf prince.
Chase Roberts,1,2025-10-18 03:59:29,"Ranking systems are trash. If you use a good strategy, it won't matter. they match you with opponents; not based on relative strength. so you're either much stronger, or much weaker than your opponents. This actually discourages people to spend money (which im assuming is the businesses goal). The matchups should be based on mean level of the 8 cards you're using."
Justus Mawhinney,1,2025-09-28 13:05:05,so freaking garbage. the game has spammers and no skill. any card you play it's either mega knight or 3 towers placed in top. regret ever spending money on this game and never will again. save yourself the trouble and never download it. I hate this game so much. I wish it was never created. I want this game to shut down and for my money to be refunded. i hope none of you all get scammed like I did.
Amruth U,1,2025-09-29 10:44:26,New content with updates? No way supercell won't update anything unless it makes them money. This game is only fun for people who can pay a lot for in-game upgrades. Want to have a casual fun experience? No way you get 20 mega knight matches in a row(or any of the other Pay-to-win evo). Supercell's greed has sucked out all the joy from this game. It's just pay to win or suffer.
derek nelson,1,2025-09-29 21:04:02,"don't play this game, at least in warthunder, you can easily win against uptiered and premium vehicles if you know where to aim, in this game, everyone is pay to win, it's an automatic loss of the opponent has 1 or 2 evos and you have none depending on the evo, the company is full of greed, hence why level 11 king towers can face two level 14s in a row or have a level 12 player with level 15 cards. this company is just as bad as ubisoft. also clan wars sucks, no level fairness."
Google Is Evil,1,2025-08-19 16:14:35,"Total pay to win snoozefest. This only evens out once you get to about 8 or 9k trophies at which point the Engagement Optimized Matchmaking System will try to closely place your win rate at 50%. They claim that your deck doesn't play a factor but it kinda clearly does. If you have a solid deck that has one or two hard counters, you will see those counters more frequently than is statistically possible. If you point this out, people gaslight you because they think it's funny. I can't recommend."
Aaron Alejo,1,2025-10-13 20:32:06,"this game is a lot of fun with friends and family, but if you do not spend any money on this game, you will barely make any progress due to all of the pay to win deals in the shop which people buy at the lower arenas which makes it really hard to progress. this game is not balanced at all it's just a money grabber."
Hudson Pudelwitts,5,2025-10-26 02:15:33,"Everyone in the review section is talking about how you have to pay money to get evolutions. However, if the 6 or 7-year-old leaving those hateful reviews had any kind of patience at all, they would realize that if you play for three months semi-consistently, you're practically guaranteed a full evolution from the pass royale free evo wild shards. You can also pull wild shards or even a full-blown evolution from lucky chests. The game is free-to-play friendly, would recommend!"
Guilbertaris Evallo,2,2025-10-23 19:12:16,"Think about it, if you're at 14000 trophies, your opponent is level 15 with max cards, How can we keep up when we can't afford to spend? imagine lvl 14 vs lvl 15 with max cards?two evolution? that I dont have! And if you fight that aren't the same level for ex 13v14 or 14v15 I think the tower that has a low level should only lose a little trophy because that's not a fair match!##"
Eric,1,2025-09-12 22:21:23,"Having played this game pretty much since release, I can't recommend a game that has pretty much shifted to pay to win. If you want to reach max level, it is pretty much impossible unless you spend thousands of dollars just to play on a even playing field against other max players. Go ahead and play the game if you like facing people with higher level cards or if you plan to spend hundreds of dollars."
Rudy Romero,1,2025-10-12 00:17:20,"this app needs to be fully deleted from all platforms, supercell doesn't know how matchmaking works, and just letting players buy everything from the start makes it an even more horrible game, it's makes people who are free to play, or just playing for fun, want to break their phone."
Robokotkin -,3,2025-09-19 01:51:23,This is game is so pay to win that you will loose it after a while. I played this game for 4 years in ca 2015-2019 or so. Downloaded it again for a month or so again as i got greedy watching play on youtube. The game play is even more p2w than before. After you play to level 10-11 evolving the cards gets super difficult as free to play. But you will start to play against players (especially in clan wars) that have 2-4 level higher cards than you. It makes it impossible to win no matter what you
Mythical Twinkie,1,2025-09-22 06:24:09,"Matchmaking is clearly rigged. if you win too many matches, it only matches you against people with decks full of hard counters. what's the point in a training mode when the AI is given a deck full of universal hard counters. you cant get better/train when the opponent has nothing but hard counters because there's literally nothing you can do. there's a reason it'd called a hard counter."
Luke Smith,1,2025-10-20 02:37:11,"It would be a great game if it wasn't pay to win, and didn't make sure you always have a 50% win rate, and wasn't littered with bots. It's not very fun to play against a level 12 mega knight in spooky town, followed by a lobotomized tin can that has a deck comprised of only spells"
Hudson Pudelwitts,1,2025-08-23 02:52:49,"If you are somehow genuinely considering downloading and playing this trash can of a game, don't. It will destroy you. The first few arenas are fun because everybody is nice and silly and usually bad at the game, but as you progress to the mid-ladder arenas, that's where the trouble begins. I ran into uncountable p2w players, so much so, that i deleted this game. If you want ANY chance at maybe winning more than 3 games in a row at BEST, you better be ready to swipe swipe that credit card, kids."
Bing H,2,2025-11-02 01:07:58,The cards that are annoying all have synergy (i.e. megaknight + rocketeer). The game encourages pay-to-win by locking the new OP Evo cards behind a $10 paywall or 3 months of grinding 3 different battle passes. A single card upgrade from lvl 13 to lvl 14 costs 75k in gold and that can take a week or more to accumulate only if you consistently play daily.
Spxll,1,2025-09-01 23:26:44,"crazy how everyone just has thousands of dollars and is able to become level 11 with every card in only arena 7. and then playing 14 elixir in 4 seconds in the start of the game?? this game has never been fun, it only favors if you pay money to the company. I wouldnt recommend unless youre a multi-millionare and have money to waste on a stupid game like this"
Brian Gibbons,1,2025-09-03 02:38:28,"horrible new player experience. once you climb high enough(if you're good and free to play), you'll start playing people with 2-3 levels on you every game. want to go down trophies to face people who are your level? you can't. you get restricted in the highest arena you've got to. playing nothing but people overleveled every game so they bait you into buying cards from the shop or playing every day to get your cards up."
Julian Vasquez,1,2025-10-13 09:10:33,This game is much pay to win. You can get up to tower 8 or 9 with rares and legendaries but past that you pretty much either have to have rng on your side and giving you the next epic characters that are broken and overpowered or spend a lot of money to open chest to get them. You can get them without having to buying chest but your chances are slim to none so don't waste your time or money on this game this is still true in 2025
marina sutormina,1,2025-10-01 07:41:04,"The game is very fun at first, but very fast turns into pay to win experience, where it would take you literally years to farm levels on your cards. Prices are not ""micro"" at all. For being such a money grab the game has extremely poor tech support, where they not only not help you with bugs but even do not reply to tickets. Sad, but unless you are made of money, the game is unplayable despite of having great potential."
Colton Palmer,4,2025-08-26 21:46:22,"Supercell, I have played the game for almost 4 years. I can say you have changed the game for the worse as a f2p. You add all of these new cards and evolutions, but you make them harder and harder to obtain. I enjoy the addition of Lucky Drops to earn these, but feel that the game was most fun as a f2p when we earned chests for each game and 3 Lucky Drops daily. On top of that, having the Daily Shop brought back will make those limited modes more fun to play. Thank You"
_Harsh_ :/,5,2025-10-04 22:31:11,"8/10 personal opinion. been playing the game for 6+ years at the moment, taken many breaks in the middle. the game screams pay to win but c'mon it's not impossible and pretty fun to play! only problem is if you don't spend, you can't upgrade cards quick enough and me at level 14 and 8000 trophies i have only 2 cards level 14 and 10 ish at 13, rest all under leveled which is annoying."
Wicktrapp,1,2025-10-28 00:38:17,"The goblin barrell and the baby dragon cards are showing to me as ""not found"" . i don't understand what that's supposed to mean . My game is updated of course and i tried clearly app cache then restarting CR to see if it's how it should be . still no m please fix this issue asap . it's hard to play without thoese two key cards"
Branden Leaders,1,2025-09-27 05:50:42,"Freezes constantly. Loading into a match, my builds to 7, or occasionally 8.4, then the game freezes for about 30 seconds and I'm already losing/lost before I get to out a card down. Hasn't been fixed in the past few updates."
Creamy,3,2025-08-14 02:30:08,"I have played this game since 2019 and I loved it, sure it has one of the most toxic communities ever and sure its p2w at some moments but that does not take away from the beauty that used to be class Royale. These new updates, however, have completely ruined the game in my eyes as it now lacks what is used to make this game special in my eyes, which are the chests, this game will be one I will always play however even someone who loves this game such as I can't help but notice the decline."
Alon Sayag,3,2025-11-04 21:46:09,"The game has been becoming much more p2w recently, and there are level 11 people with max level cards left and right... the problem is matches like those require no strategy and the opponent can simply place overleveled troops and your low level towers have nothing to do against it. Most of these people do not even have a year played"
Amol Patthe,1,2025-10-05 01:11:54,"The game is not working properly. It either fails to load, crashes during startup, or freezes while playing. I have tried restarting the device and checking the internet connection, but the issue still persists. Please help resolve this problem as soon as possible."
Zuhayr Ahmed Abling Khan,1,2025-10-07 00:10:08,"trash game . game made for players who spend money . the game is addictive at the start and then you will slowly realize this game is truly unbalanced , this is because of the evolution cards that are overpowered. the times before evolution was fun players built their own strategy and skills but now build a High elixir deck and 3 crown the enemy in one push ( beatdown decks). unstoppable. for the others who think it's a skill issue let me tell you that no matter what ur defense needs some cash"
Trancurve playz,3,2025-08-17 20:00:37,"This game used to be a five star but since a couple years ago things have gone downhill. bad introduction of new cards, the overpowered releases on purpose for company profit, bad Evo distribution (giving it to cards which don't need it) and my newer issue of bad WiFi management for no reason, has been some of many issues this game has been having."
Mike,3,2025-09-09 19:29:27,"it's entertaining, and there are no ads, so that alone beats most other games I played. I don't like that 80% of the dice are more coins..early on. that may be helpful later, but when I am at level 10 and I have 5 guys between level 1 and 6 I wondering if the algorithm is not working. every card is helpful. if the point is to give more coins then have less dice because those and the chest are the only time to levelup and when i don't get a card I feel down and that it's going to be hard to win"
h,1,2025-08-23 03:57:45,"This game cuts off the internet for no reason. It makes you lose frequently to play consistently, and also a game that causes mental illness and stings very much, but if you pay money for the game you will win. If you don't pay for the game, you will suffer as much as I do. So I hope that the game will return to normal and be more balanced so that everyone can play fun and not bully and insult others."
Devan Smith,1,2025-10-04 06:51:47,"Its just pay to win. People can spend hundreds of dollars to max out decks in lower arenas, which they do often. It doesnt get better with time. Matchmaking doesnt take card levels into account. I have now faced multiple level 10 king tower opponents with level 13+ decks (usually megaknight) and nothing changes. its been like this for months and the devs will never solve this issue because theyre too worried about money."
Cooper Stone,1,2025-09-03 20:08:13,Never get this game. Supercell has killed the game for any f2p or low spenders. At a certain point in the game you get put up against the same decks over and over. They have a bad algorithm for match making and the game is filled with over leveled players.
Nathan Graham,1,2025-09-24 02:38:48,"Impressive how greedy developers can be! From what was once an incredible game, now I can't play ranked because I need to get to 15000+ trophies where everyone has full level 15 cards and towers. My log can't even kill princess anymore, how is this supposed to be fun? Honestly it's shameful, greed is humanity's biggest flaw, and these devs are a plague."
Mats Samuelsen-Magne,1,2025-09-11 02:40:16,This game makes me want to SMASH MY PHONE everytime i lose and thats not cincaraly a bad thing since the competition in this game is very exiting and fun but when it comes to the pay to win aspect of the game the game lacks creativity since there are offers that boost your competitive advantage. However despite this the game is fun and exciting to play. NERF THE PRINCE OR ELSE I WILL TRY TO BREAK MY PHONE.
Rishabh Saini,1,2025-10-08 20:44:14,The merge tactics mode sucks! It is so buggy especially in the random promotion modifier. Troops of one player would randomly switch with another player's troops. Troops would change spots due to lag or something with troops on bench. Supercell forgot a basic step of testing.. . Go vibe-coding!
Thinley Wangchuk,1,2025-08-13 23:49:21,"I've been loyal to this game for 6 years and every time I updated it becomes worse. This game only cares about money (pay to win). F this game, I know your algorithm makes us with no pass royal gamers harder. edit: my tower level is on level 11 but why am I always placed against a tower level higher than me. I'm always against level 12,13,14 and even 15 sometimes"
Alexander Alex,1,2025-10-18 18:36:16,"more then 7 years play this game , unfortunately the game is created in a way that they make you lose by lagging 0.3 mls enough to not put the hero counter the enemy, is for years they do this so you put more money in and they let you then to win , I don't recommend to take seriously this game because you all will be sad disappointed"
Crits Giggles,1,2025-09-30 07:32:08,"Still crashes reliably on my rooted phone, without any explanation as to why. Updates via any application store other than Google Play are failing more often lately. Still has great core gameplay, but the developers are either lazy or complicit with Google overreach."
King Kronos,2,2025-10-02 02:59:52,"The games good, played for 9 years now just im forced to quit after the most recent update. Ive got the S22 Ultra with 40gbs of space left, the game crashes whenever I try opening it & if I open through the app store it just redirects me back.. I contacted supercell & they told me I have to buy a whole new phone in order to continue playing?? Lost what was going to be a life long player, thanks supercell 👍"
Vghhh Bb,1,2025-10-23 22:29:15,"As a player who daily plays or grinds on this game,the state of the game is bad it is really annoying how p2w players will always have the upper hand, i have experienced playing against maxed 15 level cards in bone pit this speaks volume. i am not complaining, guess spending money is the way to play."
River Hand,2,2025-10-25 23:47:30,"Another pay to win. I can't win and always get knocked down by P2W players. Highly dislike games like this. It's an only money wanting game. At least there are no ads, but toxic emotes/players. If you have money, pay the game ig, but if you dont be ready or throw your phone."
Ryan Jacob,1,2025-09-08 06:03:41,"Very pay to win, basically no way of winning at the start of each season with all the pay you win players using the new broken card. After winning like 3-4 games with your deck, the game will find every player after that to just counter every card in your deck."
Mylan Saveer,1,2025-09-10 02:40:42,I got a 20 second lag spike and lost in a game I was easily winning right after I payed 2 win 5 dollars only but still payed but I guess I have to pay even more and I also keep getting hit with lag spikes whenever I'm In a bad position also whenever your about to hit a Gould like geting a strain amount of crowns you immediately face a hard counter and go on a losing streak
Dylan Lindberg,1,2025-08-16 10:04:41,"Every game after a win streak for a week (at least) is against a pay 2 win using mega knight and Valk, fix your matchmaking, and maybe you would have a half decent game. The games only purpose is to make Supercell money because the game is practically unplayable if you don't pour your life savings into the game. There are so many things you could do to make it better, but all you do is take away stuff that helps free to play players. Supercell is the greediest gaming company, up there with EA"
Frankie Griego,1,2025-11-04 04:06:38,developers keep changing the dynamics of each character and making the game trashhh. played over 9 years they can't do anything right. made the game suck. wouldn't recommend to anyone that enjoys games
Wladys “chileno” Peñaloza Rojas,1,2025-08-30 02:02:27,"I lost my two biggest accounts... and tried to recover the accounts and when I connect I am level 1 and if I try to communicate with support it only connects me to a bot, I lost years and money invested just to create something called Supercell ID, what are the Google and Facebook accounts for if when I want to connect a new account is created"
Kadence Harper,1,2025-09-24 08:45:21,this game I will say as a concept is good and I enjoyed the game for 8 years and now at this point it's just disrespectful. if you don't have every card level 15 and your in a high arena you just lose straight up. you can't try out any new comps you just have to one trick all the way up. even if you can do that it takes literally years to get a new team all the way 15 and by then they've added 7 new ways to force you to pay in order to compete with other people. this is the most pathetic P2W.
Jessica Augustyn,4,2025-11-03 17:41:37,Clash Royale the game that hates to see you succeed. The algorithm is actively putting you against people with higher card levels or hard counters not to mention the broken evos who are great if you pay money but otherwise they suck. The game tries to keep you at a 50/50 win to lose ratio making it very frustrating to play especially path of legends as I know am stuck in Royal Champ and theres nothing I can do because my high level cards dont match the meta. Honestly I dont see this game lasting
Matt Taylor,3,2025-11-02 04:41:44,this game is fun if you like to keep getting your butt kicked so much by a person with cards that are 2 or so levels higher than you are. like whoever made this app needs to fix the match making to make it way more fair than going against a person with level 13-14 cards when you only have level 11 cards on hand. oh also most of the stuff is p2w which then makes the matches even more unfair when going against them
Syam Sai,4,2025-08-16 10:14:53,"edited from 1 star : this game is in much better shape than it was a few years ago. better rewards, not much shortage of coins, but getting legendaries is still pretty hard and same goes for other rarity cards, but the magic items has helped quite a bit. matchmaking is better and is done based on card levels in deck on average, before it was quite unfair not now anymore."
Rodrigo Grecco,1,2025-08-28 08:33:47,"what just happened to this game? I played this game for years,and every time I enter the game again to play casually, I get sick straight away. just offers trying to rip you off, everything became money money and money. this was awesome years ago, I had to edit my post (I said previously this was the best game ever), but nowadays,I think the creators just want to lose all the members. good luck while you guys can have people playing this poor game. very sad to see what you guys did to this game"
abdullah ali,1,2025-09-06 02:41:52,was one of my favorite games one time had 7k trophies on a old account but the amount of in game transactions on a single mobile game is crazy if you really want to get alot of trophies in this game then get ready to spend a fortune one this game but if you can't then don't play the game at all.
Nate Thompson,4,2025-10-31 02:01:23,"very fun. I never really wanted to play, but I downloaded because lots of my friends played and its actually much more fun than I expected. lots to do and battles to win. action packed tense game. definitely based towards teenagers tho. however the king guy is funny so I like it"
Uday Yadav,1,2025-10-04 22:51:23,this game has become very pay 2 win and it is impossible to pick this game up at the moment. Everybody has 3-4 level higher cards than me. Unless the game is balanced again i won't really be having fun. My friends who payed grew expnentially fast and i couldn't keep up.
Celeepy,1,2025-10-15 20:19:13,"The game's balance is so bad that I have doubts that there is a balancing team. The fact that it's a supercell game makes it a pay-to-win game. The fact that it takes months for F2P players to get a fraction of what paying players get is absurd. Supercel tends to release new cards that are absurdly broken to the point you question if they test it beforehand, get people to spend money and buy it, just to nerf it a couple of days after. This company is just a greedy pile of slop."
German monke,1,2025-10-16 08:08:54,"terrible game, they make it hard to play this game without paying, removed season shop one of the best thing for f2p players because ""it wasn't doing it for most people"" when they still have the trader who is completely useless, this game is horrible if you don't use your credit card, if I could rate this -5 stars I would"
Mate Margishvili,1,2025-09-20 02:59:10,"This game is dogsh*t, its full of lags and freezes. Minutes ago i was playing trophy road and i had to win 2 more games to hit 15k,guess what happend, it froze and lagged. when i tried to close the app and open it again it wouldnt let me in, i lost the match,the trophies and my motivation is gone.i broke my new phone to cause of my anger. in conclusion this game is just pay to win and supercell just wants money ,they don't care about humans and society having fun."
Kiley Rochat,1,2025-08-30 12:48:50,"Came back for merge combat, which was fine for a while. However, the flaws of the *short* design made it unbearable the farther I got. After that, I started playing the rest of the game, which was the reason I quit years ago. The game has changed a lot, I'll admit, but frankly it's still the game I loath. I'd give merge combat a 5/10 Cons: Frustratingly limited/empty shops, limited tribe access, lack of gameplay variety, unhelpful/detrimental UI, and unsatisfying conclusions Pros: It's short"
Gomibako,1,2025-09-17 02:21:33,unless you are willing to spend money most of your time playing will be losing to unfair matchups. of course there is skill but it doesn't matter when there is a 2-3 level difference with your opponents. the games store is full of greedy prices encouraging you to pay to level up your cards which most players have to if they want to stand a chance once they gain more trophies. there is no fast way to level up your cards as a free to play player unless you play for hundreds of hours. dont bother.
Phillip Jeong,3,2025-09-07 04:00:50,"This game is fun and addictive, but the some of the cards are unfair and questionable, like the Mega Knight are a tank but it can walk a medium speed and jump fast. Another thing is that firecracker and dart goblin are very annoying because of their long, fast, and their Evo can make it worse."
Ethan Zhang,1,2025-10-03 08:22:34,"Don't get me wrong, its a fun game. People who claim its pay to win and overleveled players ruin the game are just bad. However, every time I try to open the game from my PC, it ""loads"" but then the window closes promptly."
M S,1,2025-09-30 21:40:27,"Elixir refills at a much slower rate than that of the opponent making you lose the match, have experienced it multiple times. You'll win only if the game wants you to. The new update is the worst and changed the level of my multiple cards, no option to rectify the problem. The only option is left to Uninstall."
Daerk HaJimE,1,2025-10-12 08:58:38,"Typical rubbish with pay to win system. Wanna more trophies? Sure, buy cards to progress and stay on the same level with those playing on your trophies. Wait, you said balance? Nah, who cares? We're gonna buff a character who already could destroy at least one of your towers with a 2-elixir-assist from his back. Don't want to pay? Well, you gotta play many years then just to gain a couple of evos. Even tetris is more engaging than this piece of rotten eggs"
D Z,1,2025-10-24 10:21:56,"Supercell Has Earned Every Ounce of Contempt From Their Community With Clash Royale and Betrayed Loyal Players. Do not waste your time or money. I spent thousands and reached the top, yet I’m overleveled and still crushed by broken mechanics and rigged matchmaking. Paying does nothing. Skill means nothing. Every update ruins balance even more. This game feeds on frustration and spits on the players who kept it alive."
kaylan pahm,4,2025-09-05 11:39:32,"This game is really fun and action based, even thouhg it uses my mind and a lot of strategy turning it into fun it can also be unbalanced due to the high money offers that some people are willing to buywhich makes it super unfair for the normal players of the world so it would be better if there were pay to win servers only or less money offers so people can actually deserve these rewards"
Chris Bachar,1,2025-09-22 12:26:25,1 star for being another cash grab game. either your opponent has been playing the game for years or it's a Smurf acc at low levels. With no protection no wonder it's such a turn off to so many people My friends in top clans spectate and laugh how out of control its at lower lvls. Don't waste your time unless you're going to invest a good chunk of your life or money.
Vangelis Katsarellos,1,2025-09-04 04:11:44,Developing against the player Removed the lucky boxes and pivoted to chests to remove the possibility of giving players decent items. Removed the ability to trade feature since you cannot get trade tokens from anywhere. Weekly special event doesn't have a level cap anymore so you are just doomed before the game event begins since your opponent has way higher level cards
Dumbass Weeb,1,2025-09-01 21:10:37,game might have the worst customer support known to man... been waiting over a week and their customer support ignores me.... this game would be so much more popular if they weren't solely focused on making money and actually made the game player friendly. play it for a bit of fun... but if you don't intend to spend money.. expect to get squashed 90% of the time in higher arenas.
Cameron Smidt,2,2025-08-28 00:25:51,Underleveled Vs P2W Sure you can still win battles but what fascinating is the fact that if youre level 9 youll fight two levels higher or a level lower. Thats just an example youll find this common for all levels in the game. (levels just mean more tower health and dmg) but what's crazier than that is being able to be level a card to max and not really gain no negative. if you dont level up all cards and just your deck youll fight underleveled players.
A Google user,1,2025-10-02 06:49:07,"Developers need to stop people being able to cheat. Putting down way more troops than the power available. Pointless playing if they are not going to stop this. supprise surprise, no comments from the developers and this is still happening. what an appalling service. Also, why is it when I am winning against a higher ranked player, do I suddenly lose connection?!. Full WIFI and no reason to lose connection. Are you ever going to sort the issues with this game?. AND STILL HAPPENING. GAME DELETED"
David Moore,3,2025-10-10 17:33:09,"it is a good game with amazing units and gameplay, but the only problem I really face it I constantly have to play against those who are I'm.higher areas then myself meaning I don't have anything that can compete with them stopping me and delaying from progressing the game, if you could just fix that issue, other than that the game is perfect."
688case,1,2025-10-02 01:18:17,"If I could give this game zero stars I would. The redeemable features of this game are scarce. On top of an already painfully pay-to-win system and style of play, the community on the game combined with overall technical issues makes the game unenjoyable and nearly unplayable. Overall, incredibly disappointing game."
Norbert Berner,2,2025-09-08 22:07:45,really fun for the first arenas but after some time it turns for the worst. Players most of them P2W or using broken decks. the only option to go further not being P2W Is grinding or hoping for a weak player . this game gives that adrenaline rush after every game or makes you rage out on something . there is to mush P2W thing in this game that make you rage when playing against them . I don't really recommend it for the long run
Tyler Williamson,1,2025-09-26 21:35:34,Good game but the losers spend hundreds of dollars to max out everything and spend hundreds more get all the shards to fully upgrade and make it unfair unless you spend a few hundred dollars. It's a good game but the people who spend money need to get a life.
Kuan Xin,1,2025-11-02 20:06:08,"Hi. I honestly gave up after going up against megaknight,boss bandit,p2w's. so many problems that they don't fix, plus there are too many p2w's I have been trying to grind trophies but the matchmaking system is just out of hand. Honestly no game has ever made me lose my mind so badly than clash royale..."
Howard Sia,1,2025-09-20 13:00:31,"With the launch of Evos the game has turned much more pay2win than before. I do not suggest coming back to playing even if you are a long time player as without evos you will feel the disadvantage unless you buy the battle pass. One example is usually the fireball can nearly one shot the wizard but with the Evo wizard he has a shield which allows the Evo player to not bother about countermatchups. Worst of all the Evo wizard is one of the weaker evos in the game, imagine that."
Matteo Herrera-Bermudez,1,2025-10-24 13:28:50,"This game is very buggy, and when there is no wifi, the wait and close app icon continues to appear, and it distracts from the actual gameplay, but overall it is a fun game buy supercell just needs to fix a fee things"
Sam Creswell,3,2025-09-28 02:58:24,"I like the gameplay and find it fun! That said, rewards are getting worse (the question mark boxes suck and are overtaking loot chests on daily rewards), and it is getting to be more pay-to-win with the introduction of evos. It's not too horrible at the moment and doesn't take too much money (you'd be fine with like $10-$15 a month), but want this standard and downward trend understood before new people try the game. Honestly, probably wouldn't have reviewed if not for the daily chests change"
Warchizle Nova,1,2025-09-18 20:30:59,"Game couldn't be any worse. plain and simple. Progression is way to slow, the game is also just pay to win slop now. Most opponents have many more evo cards then you do because they are willing to use their wallets. Its disgusting and a terrible experience. Don't recommend it to anyone trying to get into this game."
Gumaro Alvarez,1,2025-08-31 06:53:18,This new update completed ruined the game. They removed chests and cut basically all the rewards and progression by around 50%. They also removed the season shop which was one of the main ways for free to play players(including myself) to earn evolutions and other rewards. Overall this update sucks and I hope supercell brings back everything they removed.🫤😞
Christian Ross (Chris),3,2025-09-13 04:23:09,"I liked the old Clash Royale with the chest system, but this version is good. It's a classic and not much different in gameplay, but with new game modes and characters. Not much new happens to capture your attention."
landen larose,5,2025-09-22 22:09:46,"Even with its strengths, there are several drawbacks people often point out: Pay-to-progress / “pay-to-win” concerns To upgrade cards (especially higher rarity), you need many duplicates + gold. Progress can get slow if you don’t spend money. et geekera +2 Google Play +2 Some players feel certain card or level disparities give unfair advantages. If opponents have more leveled cards, they do more damage / have more health. Skill helps, but sometimes the card level gap is decisive. et geeke"
Arif,2,2025-11-01 15:46:43,"Every aspect of this game is good, even great. But one thing made it a 2 star review. Pay to Win. This absurd issue kill the whole game. How am I suppose to win without spendinh money? The rate my opponent outlevel me from 10% to 90%. Please, make it lmr"
Isaac Yang,2,2025-10-15 06:28:16,"The game has become too pay to win. I'm level 8 king tower in jungle arena, and I see a level 12 knight. in past games, I've also come across evolution baby dragon, which is pay to win. this makes it nearly impossible for free to play players like me, to actually have fun instead of going against some pay to win player who thinks they're good at the game for buying their wins. It just feels like I'm playing because I'm addicted, not because I'm having fun."
Hello Dear,2,2025-08-22 18:51:35,I played clash royale for more than eight years. I think this game is good enough but I have a serious problem they don't have a good algorithm for match making . I have lvl 12 king but it matches with lvl 14 king. I wanted to give 5 stars but their algorithm constantly keeps me losing matches more than I can tolerate.
David,1,2025-08-26 23:50:29,"predatory monetization - bait and switch from decent low leveler battler to pay to play battler once you are mid tier. get 1 free reward, get shown the paid reward has 100x more than the free. pointless to try and compete if you are not paying unless you have unlimited time and patience."
Level 0 Crook,2,2025-08-26 21:29:59,"Played clash royale for a long a time back in the day. Recently came back to play because of jynxzi. Bro, are they taking advantage of the hype its getting? Why is it so blatantly pay to win now? 80% of the matches im clearly outmatched in terms of level, my princess towers are only level 5 whilst the enemy's are atleast 2 levels higher than mine bro. What happend to this game man?"
Levter Venelinov,1,2025-08-21 02:45:10,"The game went from probably the most amazing game you could get on a phone to complete and utter garbage. Ever since they removed the clan chests the game has started to go downhill. From completely broken and boring cards that bring you easy wins to pay to win offers which make me want to gauge out my eyes with a spoon. Now the game is only fun before players are introduced to mega knight, boss bandit and much more cancerous and toxic ""cards"" which have completely ruined this ""skillful"" game."
Andre Onque,2,2025-08-29 12:53:04,"unfortunately I've decided to quit the game, ive been playing since launch and I've spent ALOT of money 💰. megaknight has been a problem since his release and nothing has been done about the balance issue. it seems they totally don't care, his splash damage and area damage and continued jumping is ridiculous to the point that everyone uses him in ladder. same with golem, hog rider, goblin barrel. they added them so players without skill can beat skilled players.. it makes absolutely no sense."
Business Suitcase,1,2025-10-30 10:36:39,"while the main gameplay is honestly a masterpiece(except for evolutions) it has sadly been plagued by monetization so bad that even when you pay 50+ bucks for whatever ""offer"" you are still put against people who have higher level cards to trick you into spending more money. amazing gameplay ruined by greedy devs🥲."
L1ghtn1ngDra90n,1,2025-09-13 19:59:53,"NEW REVIEW: This game has turned into money horde, evo and spell spam. I may as well be challenging Bezos to a competition to buy the most imaginary beans in a card game except Bezos relies on money and spamming things that deal damage and cannot be blocked rather than actual strategy like he would if he were a real person. This game has gone from a fun and interesting concept to a casino roulette for children. This is now unplayable for those without throwaway cash. OLD REVIEW: 4 Stars 豆が大好きです。"
GHOST _,3,2025-08-27 01:03:39,"Throughout the years of playing this game it was fun, a classic for sure, but throughout the updates it slowly got more pay to win and free to play got more nerfed, it still gets worse every update but if you buy a couple passes you can keep up, it's coming to a downfall."
Alex W,1,2025-10-19 14:15:38,"If you aren't willing to spend hundreds of dollars into this mess of a game don't even bother downloading it. It's primarily pay to win and you will be going against players with overleved evo cards no matter what arena your in. Personally I tried so hard to give the game a chance and it failed time after time. I have never in my life seen such a bad game, from the pay to win and horrible matchmaking to the atrocious leveling system this game is genuinely horrible. Supercell is just here for $$$"
Nabeel Ahamadali,3,2025-10-24 00:56:23,"Good game, however i have noticed people who spend money to buy upgrades are getting some privileges like they are able to block our moves and they get 1.5x speed. Deployment of troops are faster etc....."
Christian Fleischman,1,2025-09-01 16:06:20,"Ive returned after two years to see all of my issues with matchmaking still remains. The game is still wildly unbalanced with a heavy emphasis on pay to win. I was able to climb roughly two arenas before being met with players two castle levels below using cards 1-2 levels above my own. The TFT knockoff was fun but is so unbalanced that two comps win any match up, its a battle of who gets it first. I still strongly suggest not playing the game and have had a regrettable time playing this slop."
A Google user,1,2025-09-13 11:33:28,"I have never played anything more poorly executed. The game is maybe fun one game a month, and I play it daily. This is because supercell might be the most greedy company I've ever seen turning literally every component of this game into pay to win. I genuinely don't understand why I have been stuck in the same arena for over 2 months because every other game I get into is somebody who bought boss bandit or dropped , 40 dollars to make every card absurdly over leveled."
Royal Repair - Alonso Alvarez,1,2025-10-18 05:53:16,"AI BOTS BY TENCENT USING FAKE PLAYERS. ABSOLUTE PAY TO WIN. UNPLAYABLE. NO HUMAN PLAYERS FOR MONTHS. Supercell is rigging their games to prevent you from winning matches. I have been eternally stuck at 12K trophies for 6 months. My card attack damage is not registering, card placements are delayed, units dying early, bot opponents receive more elixir rates. The game is 9 years old. It has more lag each year. It is deliberate by design. AVOID THIS GAME. REPORT AND FLAG THEM FROM THE PLAYSTORE."
manish shakeya,1,2025-09-14 02:56:16,"Game is good, but matchmaking is certainly not, you will never ever be a winner in this game. This is like a toxic gf, and now they have introduced new elixer slowing tactics, the moment you deploy a player, notice the slowness in elixer bar... this is all to favour customers who are paying huge amount in this game."
Terry,5,2025-08-20 05:49:39,"Absolutely Amazing!! Growing up, I know you all remember the classic Clash of Clans, well, this right here is an amazing new fun idea and adventure!! I mean seriously!! Collecting battle cards is so exciting, and I just love the whole battle mechanics. The cost per card is fair, and the timer is quick, and I think if I'm not mistaken, that the last 30 seconds of a battle the timer speeds up, allowing you to send out huge amounts of Troops to guarantee you can get those 3 Crowns!! 👑 👑 👑"
Bradford Wight,1,2025-09-04 01:12:00,"This game sucks. The ranking point system is dumb. Leveling up cards is just a way for them to make money off of gambling addicts. The matchmaking is bogus and feels like it is rigged to make you lose so will spend money to win. Typical session: win a few games with a good deck, then start facing opponents with every counter card to mine. So I change decks, and then rinse and repeat ad infinitum. Screw this game."
Jeffery O'Neil,1,2025-09-06 05:19:32,"GREEDY MONEY HUNGRY DOUCHEBAGS don't play unless you want to spend 100k to upgrade to a max account. Used to be halfway decent now not even close, buy the month pass which seems like a good deal until you need to upgrade don't even get any evolutions either, which are NEEDED to complete at any lvl 2million coins just to upgrade the rest of my lvl 13 cards to 14 and there's a lvl 15. oh and it's about 20$ for 100k gold do the math on that. No support for merge tactics either, 1 star well deserved"
Stefan,1,2025-10-23 22:34:52,if i could give it 0 I would. This is genuinely the most annoying game of this earth considering all the people that have money or all the kids that steal their parents money progress in this game ridiculously fast. fighting in the clan war is disgusting as level7 get put with level 11 or me level 10 put against level 12 or 13 with their cards almost to max just because they spent money. not all of your player base has money to put in a stupid game. and you call it free to play. Disgusting
Joe Mosher (JediJoMo77),1,2025-10-08 00:19:00,"tried the game out, and if you don't have 100s of $ you can't progress. The developers only care about money and rewarding p2w players. As soon as something is liked, it is taken away. dont get the game unless you have money for a new phone and the game."

Kiril Baleca,1,2025-09-21 16:26:57,"If you're friends are telling you to get this game move to a different country and cut the connections to them, this game is so unbelievably bad that you have to have the mindset of a koala to be calm while playing. If you already have the game quit before it gets too addictive because if you don't you will play the game every day just to rage quit after 1 battle, the only way to save the game is to make it actually playable for f2p players."
Foul Goblin,5,2025-10-29 16:37:50,great game for quick bursts of fun. would be even better if you could at least discard chests to make room for that special one... 2025 update: bots galore. have to recommend you skip this game as you will be playing against bots for most of the time.
Chill n Listen,1,2025-10-13 04:36:46,"I don't think I can get my account back after so long of not touching this game, almost 9 to 8 years ago I stopped playing and wanted to come back but the Google play button is gone and I didn't use SC ID so now I'm just stuck with nothing but a box that tempts me with logging back into my old account but goes to SC ID login which that account doesn't have."
Chris,3,2025-10-19 01:00:33,"ok game i started playing about a year before tower troops were added, cool cards but the main problem is balancing in both the cards and progression cause some cards are really overpowered and progression cause sometimes i play against someone 14 levels above me (especially in clan wars) also the merge royale should just be its own game it doesnt really fit clash royale also please make evolution shards easier to get. also stop being so gosh darn pay to win"
Silas Smith,1,2025-10-10 01:08:59,"It is a terrible game do not install this game, if you want to play the game and win you have to spend at least 500 dollars. if you are seriously thinking about installing this game and having fun you need 500-800 dollars to spend and you need to play for 5 hours a day, DO NOT INSTALL!!!"
Jackson Selfridge,1,2025-10-14 01:34:16,"The developers do NOT care about this game. They will constantly buff cards that don't need it, leave other cards untouched that are practically useless.

Adding more and more to make it less winnable. match matching intentional to prevent progression."
Akmal Rafi A A,2,2025-09-19 08:25:43,"it's a good game, though not very free-to-play friendly. it's fun and addicting but the grind is brutal, good luck having more than two decks as a f2p. I'm an old player and the new evolutions made the gap between f2p and p2w players even bigger, granted you can get evos if you grind enough. other than that, the matchmaking is unfair, you WILL match against players that are over-leveled AND have evolutions. overall, the game has shifted more towards spenders than casuals."
Dusan Kamenov,1,2025-10-18 19:28:54,"PAY TO WIN GAME. It was fun for a week, but it is impossible to progress without buying the more powerful cards. Love the mechanics but you just can't compete without $$$."

Kendrick Lopez,1,2025-09-05 03:13:10,"Once a great game, now it's so down in the trash, I was one of the first few to play this game and to see it fall this far is crazy, the new characters are so overpowered, Firecracker mostly, but it's just become so pay to win and revolving around overpowered unbalanced metas. Supercell really fell off."
genadi petrov,3,2025-10-06 20:44:32,"Love the game. I have put many hours and money in it. However, the new season just dropped(rock & rule) and all the minor issues are very frustrating. First: you still haven't fixed the best season bug why should I even push after ultimate champion when the score just gets deleted from my account🤔. Second: you only apply regional pricing to some of my alt accounts so I am basically getting scammed if I buy stuff on my main account and I can't even donate the cheaper pass TO MYSELF."

Jaylen Kelly,4,2025-10-17 07:18:28,"It's not the worst game ever, but also not the best. Somehow your opponent can produce elixir faster than you can, and also matched with pay to win people.

I give this four stars."
Anthony Beckman,1,2025-09-04 16:25:11,"As fun as it can be starting out, the second you run into someone who's spent money on the game it's clear all thought and strategy is a complete waste of time. It's genuinely pathetic how much this game has fallen into a hole this deep."
Nihal Mahay,2,2025-11-01 00:28:02,Yet another pay to win game that makes it almost unplayable for people who want to play for free. Why can people get cards that are unlocked from higher arenas? It just defeats the purpose of the game. Also dont even get me started on mega knight. Delete it.
Josiah Dejesus,1,2025-09-24 04:06:27,"It's pure payed to win. When you are close to making it to the next arena, this game matches you against people who have way higher level cards, and I'm in a low arena where people have level 11 or 12 cards. As soon as I am close to the next arena I'm constantly placed with people who have level 13, 14, and 15 cards that are hard to deal with since they have more health and do more damage."
Luke Smith,1,2025-09-23 19:02:25,"horrible game. I mean, people currently are only playing it because some popular streamer picked it up and paid his way to getting max level cards. It's impossible to max out an entire deck if your f2p. I still play it, however, because it'd like a toxic relationship at this point. the game punishes you for playing it. The only way to really have fun in this game is if you join a clan and their actually friendly. Otherwise your just gonna be in pain playing this game."

Washington Kids,2,2025-11-01 23:36:29,"I felt like pulling my skin out while playing this game the first few arenas are easy but I kept running into pay to win people although this is a good strategy game i ran into more people with good cards or get out leveled my fix to this is leting people not buy cards and instead let them buy emotes, gems, or coins also a winstreak would look cool"
Richard Montoya,2,2025-10-07 19:59:22,"impossible to play without spending money.

Naayl Arham,3,2025-10-20 23:00:54,"the only reason this game gets a 3 star is because how pay to win it is, and the increase in hackers is actually crazy, so I'm in Ur average arena 10 game and then this guy at the start of the game just casually drops wizard witch scarmy Valk and barbs right of the bat and if I didn't know that in total is like 22 elixir so that was game, in short supercell do something abt these elixir hackers"
Alex Johnson,3,2025-10-18 21:28:45,Merge Tactics has a flaw. The wizard team up is not accurate. I just had a game where they kept making a 2-star a rabbit when there were 4 3 star units on the field. This makes me feel that the rankings are already pre-determined and no actual strategy truly helps. I thought merge Tactics would be a good break from trophy road but that just irritated me too far. Fix Merge Tactics and make it so it's not already determined who will win.
Aiden Kitching,1,2025-09-14 04:49:43,"I don't know why you expect people to play this game anymore. Level 9 kick tower in arena 9 always going again people with champions, evos or cards that can't be unlocked yet (pay to win) also going against higher level players. Ruined the game and just not fun anymore. Bit of a waste of time developing this game tbh. If only 0 stars was an option..."
BRHUOM,1,2025-09-20 20:53:24,This game is not playable anymore. The same scenario happens every single season they release a new evolution they make it so strong and nerf the other evolutions so that you have to buy the new evolution but after the season it gets nerfed so bad that it's not playable anymore so basically it's a waste of money. These continuous nerfs make the game so bad because you have to track every nerf after every single season to know if the cards are playable or not which makes the game not even fun
Rus,2,2025-09-11 16:03:06,I've been playing for over 9 years as a free-to-play and I just can't enjoy this game anymore. The fact that I get matched very often with players with substantially higher level cards than me makes the experience just unfun and even frustrating.
Ethan Desilets,4,2025-09-17 02:46:15,"hey supercell, if your seeing this, please add a machinic to the game that makes it whenever someone losses internet they don't lose or win a game, they stay at the same trophies without any punishment at all whatsoever. it happened to me and I went down 500 trophies all because the vane wouldn't load in. it's really upsetting, I would give it three in a half stars just because of how that bug or whatever is with internet a games. but that's just me. I can't find anything else really bad so add"
Gannon Dow,2,2025-08-13 19:38:14,I started 9 years ago and always thought the game was pay-to-win but the addition of evo cards is ridiculous. You want someone to play $12 for an evolution. The Mega Knight did not need one. I keep getting ruined by people who have spent money on the game and it drives me crazy.
Jackson Massey,3,2025-09-29 19:38:02,"It is just pay-to-win now. Overall, the game is good, but the spammers just took the fun out of it. I used to be a mega knight user myself, but the cheap wins were just taking the fun out of a fun game. However, when I do take mega knight out of my deck, there is always a guy with one. Don't get this game if you want to play casually or have a light wallet."
Parker Hallum,1,2025-10-19 08:47:44,"Listen let me rap my opinion to you...When I first downloaded this game I thought it was fun and free to play...until I noticed that the bots have 1mill elixir they be knocking my tower like straight killas.Wait I still have more, ahem how come when I win one time there's a skeleton army with evo on the enemy's team and inferno knocking all my towers like a Lazer beam. This game is pay to win you want to know how because you can buy basically every evo in the shop place. that's wraps×_×"
Liam wilson,3,2025-09-07 00:53:48,fun game but can be incrediably aggravating. started playing back at launch and loved it. took a break and was still fun but the p2w is kinda out of control. Edit- evos have made the game so so aggravating. theres literally 0 downside. like you just get a bettter unit ever 2 or throw cycles. its bs. and its so difficult to get f2p.
Justin Westerhof,1,2025-10-18 07:12:25,"Pay to win trash heap. This game of degenerates who say this game is good are lying. This overrated dopamine game is irreplaceably ruining your minds. First, this is a luck game. And the games are decided as soon as the games start. Second, the game gets worse the more time you play. I somehow got to arena 7 and the games are unentertaining. And there's barely any goal to strive for. Third and final. This game is pay to win. there are apparently things called ""evolutions"" there 12$ and broken."
aadarash pandey gaming,5,2025-10-23 21:14:54,"Game is fun for both strategists and spammers, also p2w players can have much more fun as likely with every game to be fair. The only thing that I am just wondering is why did I have to empty 5 gb space from my phone to download the latest probably only ""1 change made"" update. That has never happened before and I hope doesn't happen often."
Lucia Deganová,5,2025-11-03 18:07:00,"Great addictive game. But opening chests (mainly if you are on the top of the arenas and have every single card) can be pain... it would be great if developers add some ""collect them all button"", or ""collect previous rewards"""
Alexander Dumi,1,2025-10-05 05:16:39,my life stats after getting this game. last time I've slept: bout a month stress tolerance: much higher times I've been happy playing this game: 3 (I was spamming) how many times I've been spammed: 2460 phones broken: 15. blood cells burst: an unhealthy amount how many holes I've got in my walls: probably bout 15 (I can't count. that's how many brain cells I've lost cause off this game) how many times I've gooned to mini pekka: enough to put me away for a while
Daniel Gatt,2,2025-08-14 04:33:52,"This is easily my favorite game for the past three years, however with each update they remove more and more contents (no more chests, no more event tokens) leading to progression being harder and the game loosing key features. I hope that the game can recover because I really want to love it"
Nisael,4,2025-08-13 15:53:32,"It's definitely a fun game but why on earth can't players choose what cards to start with in the beginning, how's it fair that I counter opp deck but because a certain card in my deck isn't in rotation at the beginning I can't defend opps push.. Sounds pretty ridiculous one way to fix that is in the beginning of the match let players choose out of the 8 cards which 4 they want to begin with or let them choose in the lobby. But other than that the game is great and I guess slightly p2w."
Varvancy 48,2,2025-09-20 04:21:59,"It's fun early game and every once in a while but the further I progress, the more simple and stupidly overpowered decks I find, people have cards they shouldnt from buying them and everything is over leveled. To be called a strategy game is correct to a point where bridge spam and combos that you can use once then sit back and win are all to common. Nevermind, the game is fine even if a little unbalanced but the player base is just awful and needs to grow up"
Edrian Zac Salvo,5,2025-10-27 08:06:13,"The game is very competitive and rewarding when it comes to battling opponents. It has well balanced gameplay, where you need quick thinking and decisive actions that affects your performance in game. Overall, I am happy to play this games and I am very excited to play with my friends."
Dennis Halsaver,5,2025-10-24 22:23:27,"Clash Royale is the greatest game of all time because it mixes strategy, skill, and fast-paced action perfectly. Every match is different, and every card you play matters. The game always evolves with new cards, challenges, and balance changes that keep it exciting. Building decks, pushing trophies, and outsmarting opponents gives a huge rush. It’s competitive, fun, and rewarding, making millions of players keep coming back. Clash Royale isn’t just a game—it’s an amazing experience."
Aashish Nagrath,1,2025-10-07 22:55:15,"a game we all once loved, ruined by pay-to-win corporate tactics, and hog spammers, unbalanced matchmaking. The only way to level up cards or get evolutions after reaching 8k trophies is by buying your way through the game, extremely unfair matchmaking makes you want to quit the game, and don't even get me started on hog spammers. Supercell really ruined a genuinely enjoyable game to make it more profitable."
Alberto B,4,2025-09-30 10:59:01,"The game's awesome, real-time strategy matches, all the characters have a wonderful design, their mechanics are too various, aslo is very nice that the games are too short and dynamic. Overall is one of the greatest movil games but it has a few problems that makes the game worst like, slow progression system, unfair matches in low Arenas, not many ways to get progression stuff. If they fix all of these things the game will improve even more."
Alec Brinig,1,2025-10-10 23:47:53,"This game is the most absolute putrid garbage that you can download. I've been on this game for 7 years now. I am a high rank I have max trophies and let me say that this game has turned into the most disgusting pay to win no skill trash I've seen in a long time. winning isn't satisfying, loosing isn't a skill issue. the devs should be ashamed and the community is brain washed into the gotcha micro transactions that make up the majority of this abysmal insult to the game it once was."
Robert Roy,1,2025-09-16 01:08:29,So pay to win. Level 15 cant be obtained without paying. I lose only to decks that are all level 15. Evolutions are so pay to win. It's impossible to get them without paying or waiting 3 months for the free pass. Ts is so boring I just play against every deck that counters me. Litterally the second I change decks the matchmaking puts me against a full counter. Genuinely hate living with this game in the world. Most greedy company ever. I cannot describe how much I hate this game because of P2W.
Ashton Cruz,5,2025-10-22 08:27:17,"good game, p2w players are not as good as they seem and easy to counter, but please 🙏 I beg take away the ability to have your king(or crown towers) to be lost to spells (specifically rocket and fire ball) and I don't mean make them stop doing any damage to towers but make it to where when the tower reaches health like 50 they can't be taken unless by fighters not spells."
Asher Sajdak,1,2025-10-07 19:22:47,"horrible game. this because if you lose internet for a millisecond, the game instantly crashes. it doesn't matter if you're in a game or not. if you are in a game, then you instantly lose the match. after a while, it gets really annoying. another really bad part about the game is its EXTREMELY pay to win. you could just be starting the game and your opponent can already have everything in the game."
Khoi,3,2025-09-21 13:53:46,"Good game, but some features suck. people have bad internet that's a thing and this game knows it, it litterly shows a bad internet symbol when lagging. getting lag is basically a free 6 do anything about really, and yet you still lose trophies. would rate it higher if you didn't lose trophies when lagging really badly"
brett bogart,3,2025-11-03 15:34:37,"VERY ptw the games mechanics are fun though, but one issue is the balancing. I personally think the games main focus is awesome, it's just that the game needs to be more f2p player friendly!"
Sonic Sonic,4,2025-10-30 06:31:51,"It's good overall, but it can be a rage baiting game, as this game is filled with pay to win users. As a free to play, my hardest challenge is to go against pay to wins, they are way too hard to go against. Imagine seeing lv 15 e barbs in arena 5, or seeing evo lv 15 firecracker in arena 6."
D Rumor,1,2025-09-26 07:02:48,The game's pretty high quality but it's pay to win like every supercell game. This game is more pay to win than the rest so don't expect to compete if you're a free to play player. You're just gonna lose to people who spent more money so it's not very competitive at all. I do not recommend this game.
Memer,1,2025-11-02 19:34:37,"Strongest card in the game is your credit card. You won't exit an arena while being paired up with people a king tower 2 levels higher than yours. And if by some miracle you win, the next opponent is no better. Unless you have money to spend this game certainly doesn't welcome you. Hell, they even removed the shop which f2p heavily relied on just to encourage us to spend money. Skill or not, you aren't beating somebody with evolved level 15 Megaknight with a level 11 mini pekka even on defense."
Omar Hatab,2,2025-09-24 05:04:42,"first of all, it would be fun to play as a skill game, but you're making the game pay to win, and it's not that hard to reduce the prizes. 2nd nurf the fricking prince, like what do you mean i have to put more than the 10 elixer to defend a man on a horse with a stick that ever 1.4 sec he sprints deali g alot of damage liek what are thinking suppercell make you games right or never make any game at all."
Blake Harrison (Blake),3,2025-10-07 22:24:31,"Fun game except when you have a tiny bit less signal it doesn't place your characters down. It makes the animation of when it places a character down (the golden sparkles), but instead puts it back into your inventory. Like it could pause the game for both sides or if one player loses connection just give the win to the other player. This would be so much more reasonable. For some reason when you have bad signal you can still watch the other person play fine but for us we can't place anything."
Ian,2,2025-09-16 14:30:44,"Why do we have to reach 15000 trophies now before we can access the ranked mode? It's made the game more frustrating than ever. If you're going to do that, then some changes need to be made to the trophy system, such as not losing as many after a loss. I have spent days just keeping the status quo and getting nowhere. Also, get rid of having to multi tap your prizes. surely a single tap is enough!! I've been playing this game for years. Losing interest now after the changes - they suck."
Jaidee Robinson,1,2025-09-17 06:48:06,"I have to say, Supercell, and it's games are some of the most greediest, and pay to win games you'll ever play in your life. Need to buy pass royale, or the brawl pass, to even get any of the currency, or level up points to be better. Other than once you reach masters, you need to pay money. Masters, and all that, is just the retirement home for old spenders."
A Google user,1,2025-10-20 17:33:31,"8yrs & Pointless 5 star chests give you items you can't use anymore, try to contact support and they've hidden text box behind phone's UI buttons! Marred by pay 2 win & unfair matchups ...Not so noticeable at the start but now at max lvl king & fully maxed deck I'm still matched vs the perfect counter-deck over and over. The feeling is as if the game has something against you or you're being punished... they just want your money and hide it all behind a thin layer of hype. no care for players"
Evan Lambros,3,2025-10-16 08:59:00,it's a good overall game.but one thing is that when I try to get on it loads up to 75 % then says updating. but then it says login error and internet error but my internet is perfect.and I cleared cache and it still doesn't work so when I uninstalled it and then download it again it still doesn't work sometimes. Supercell fix your game! I just tried to download it again and it reset my download at 93% I'm about to crash out
Joel Artman,5,2025-10-22 05:55:31,"While I will admit the game might be P2W if you're at the top of ladder, you don't need to spend money if you use the resources that they give you well. Also, complaints about evolutions don't hold anymore, as they've been super generous with evos lately."
James Bayer,1,2025-09-24 11:31:51,"THIS IS THE MOST WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED! I have been playing this game for 2 years now, and it just gets worse and worse. the meta changes almost every other month, which means your old main deck will now get trampled, and it isn't even fair! I just played 7 matches and LOST ALL 7 IN A ROW WITH MY TOP DECKS! and that took me down a WHOLE ARENA! this game sucks, the card balancing sucks, it all sucks. and if you want to be ""good"" at the game, just fork over $11 for the pass for an Evo. p2w"
terencejoeff salvidar,1,2025-09-04 18:36:39,"it sucks that every new card that gets released just makes me want to quit, unbalanced and just too op, and this is the game where you need a high level set of cards to win, skills won't matter tbh, in my 3 years of playing it and staying positive, the game had always sucks, i just go back to play it every 3 months and quit because it's just straight up frustrating to play against an overleveled player"
Amir Grubb,1,2025-10-27 10:35:23,"one of the worst games of all time. it used to be amazing but now almost every card has an evolution, its like chess with super attacks. I hope this game shuts down for good because nothing has made me want to jump off a cliff more than this piece of garbage."
Voidazru,1,2025-10-17 12:12:09,"Insanely pay to win, new cards are badly designed and this stupid rock festival whatever is so out of place and the music is so annoying, time to lay down this game for good. After 9 years of playing, it's just been bad update after bad update (mega knight evo, vines, egiant, baby dragon evo, 2.6 cycle etc etc.)"
Steve Abrams,1,2025-10-15 11:46:12,"This could be a good game, but some how the winner is decided by the programming instead of the strategy of the players. For some games you cannot keep up with your opponent, because they produce elixir faster somehow, only if you haven't purchased more gems. edit...I deleted this game for a long time. A little while ago I downloaded it again and it is still a lot of fun but it also will not let you win some. So I will delete it again."
Daniel S,3,2025-09-25 09:59:53,"Ranked mode needs a serious rework. It's basically unplayable because the scripted matchmaking is so terrible. For context I have 15k trophies so I'm a decent player. But no matter what deck I use in ""ranked"" I almost ALWAYS getat he'd against a hard counter. There's no consistency and it just feels like it's just blatantly being done deliberately."
Zavorra 5000,1,2025-08-21 05:51:51,"Game was p2w from the start but it wasn't as bad and it felt that players for the most part had similar progression. Now every match I play 95% of the time I encounter level 13, 14, 15 troops with towers of much higher level while I'm stuck at 12, not to mention evolution cards which completely mess up the little balance the game had left. back in the days getting a legendary was really hard and now I could get 9 in a lucky drop and somehow still only manage to get a level 11 card from it"
Ismael Diaz,4,2025-10-20 11:56:08,"great game, I enjoyed playing it after years. It has a bit overleveled P2W players but it's still fairley easy to play as a F2P player if you know how to play the game. Only problem is that I cant get no trade tokens without buying offers."
RSM Corp,1,2025-08-24 19:16:40,"Now I hate this game for bad match making. Get +25 trophies on win, -32 on lose. bug and stop elixir generating on beginning of the game to lose the game reasoning of restart. I need 1 trophy to reach 10000. then we go down to 9600 cause this bad issues. After the review I playing the last game that I losing cause bug on generating elixir and spend for card. So finally I will uninstall the game."
Mark Current,1,2025-08-26 05:21:45,The game itself is a great idea but it is just pay to win. maybe fun if you want something casual that you're not going to be invested in. but if you want to feel any progress or satisfaction be willing to pay a minimum of a few thousand dollars.
King,1,2025-09-20 10:40:13,"I was just trying to have some fun and suddenly get hit with the most awful loose streak ever. Almost every person I went against used toxic emotes. And most of them were pay to win. I started not too long ago. I am on arena 16, and I'm already tired of it. I might return if my friends ask for tips, but until then, screw this game."
Who's this?,1,2025-07-11 04:20:39,"I have been playing this game almost since it has been released, it is beyond disappointing how far this game has fallen in terms of quality. The game is fun for the first couple arenas before you hit a slog of over leveled players, who win because they spent money to over level their cards. All gameplay comes to a grinding halt if you don't want to spend any money, and the experience becomes miserable. Beyond disappointed at how bad it's gotten."
Adem Kahraman,5,2025-10-21 03:28:57,"update: w game. so fun generally im lovin it. they have fixed so much problems since last time I reviewed and the game is so fun. the new evolutions have all been for cards in need of them, the amount of opportunities to get evo shards for cards has been crazy and they have been able to balance some cards. dart goggins on top🔥"
Ryan Woon,1,2025-10-20 18:12:45,"An extremely UNFAIR and PAY TO WIN game. After you progress a lot, the game will ban you and ask you to pay money to lift the ban. After you lift the ban, the game will send an email requesting money for a copyright fine, which includes something you clearly didn't do. Deleted this nonsense. Also the game always gives certain YouTubers bot opponents to promote the game. Purposely disconnects certain people when they are winning to keep noobs happy or when you about to hit a milestone"
Daniel Moura,1,2025-10-14 03:39:30,"I've lost my 8 year old account because i can't access my Supercell ID. I contacted the support but didn't solve this problem. I was waiting for the confirmation code on my email, but says that they haven't found any account with my email. But it is wrong because a year ago I was able to log in with that email and i still have the code confirmation on my inbox. I've spent money on that account and is a valuable account for being created 8 years ago."
Braxton Stanley,5,2025-10-11 23:43:09,"I also play it on my Iphone (I'm on A7 there), and it is no different than playing on my laptop. Props to the game developers, this is a very fun game, but can be stressful at times. It's too fun that I play it during school (when permitted)."
Miere,1,2025-09-08 02:07:16,"Swear some people are just lagging switch or something, my internet is perfect and seamless. But against certain players I am stuck in an endless loop where I can't play any cards against them, I lose, the next game it's perfectly fine."
Matthew Whitworth,1,2025-08-29 07:17:09,I play games that I should win. I keep going up and down im score being put against lvl 14 towers while I'm 12 and ok merge tactics I've played games I should have won many times this game is becoming stupid. I've played for years keep quitting because I can never win matches I should have.... I would spend money on the game but its becoming a letdown!!!
Hercules 623,1,2025-09-20 21:42:41,"This game is horrible. They have added evos which are overpowered and in order to get them you have to pay, so it's a pay to win game, whoever has a lot of money wins the most games. Insane logic, trash game, pay to win there's no savings that. Don't play it, it will only make u mad as it's supposed to. Trash Pay to win game"
Karim Alfaiomi,1,2025-09-25 20:26:51,"The worst pay to win game ever. everything in this game is winnable if you have money. Everytime I play i get matched with someone who has all cards max and has paid for evo's while i dont even have one. Gems have become useless, everything cost realmoney now. If you play clan games you get matched with player who are also max level while you are 2 level under. Dont start playing this game. 0/10"
Chief541,3,2025-10-08 01:01:09,"the game is fun but there is way too many instances where players are advantaged, such as more card drops letting them have higher levels more often and now evos which take ages to grind without spending money making the game incredibly pay to win as evos can make cards far too powerful for their elixir cost and cost far too much to defend without evos of your own, thanks to the current dev team the meta may change constantly but a playes debit card will always be the strongest thing"
Jake Baker,1,2025-08-17 03:52:59,"Long story short, I was sitting in my living room playing clash against this kid who clearly has 0 life and sits in his chair that has a battle bucket attached to it, and his deck was the weirdest thing I have ever seen that i don't even want to say what it is, and then a car drives through my house right into my back and I lost the game and it was my rank up game to boot camp and now I'm paralyzed waste down. Thank you supercell!!!😃👍 (would not recommend game)"
Malachi,5,2025-10-27 20:35:10,"probably one of the most fun games to play when bored. I haven't gotten into any issues, except for one thing...Pay to win players. Other than that, make sure you play when you have at least a minimum of 5 minutes to play free time, otherwise you might have to leave mid game and lose your game."
rajendra kunwar,3,2025-10-20 20:45:22,this game is fun and challenging it helps to control Stress but the one thing that has destroyed the game is pay to win about 80% of the items in the shop can be bought with money . In my opinion I have lost interest in this game because of pay2win
Terenc Videnović,1,2025-10-15 17:43:55,"this game is dumb, so I pay for packs upgrade them to lvl 15 and they are useless as other players have different cards and if I use the same cards other players have i again lose eaven if they are upgraded as again the systems gives exactly those opponents that can counter my cards i wish I never bought neither 1 pack from this app...after getting to 8k thropies your on a black point no moving forward nor backward...."
Ian Richie,1,2025-09-30 06:22:56,"at first it's fun, but then you realize how much of a paywall there is to proceed. the fact that they can charge you 10 dollars for a card (which won't fully level it up btw) is absurd. that's not even the worst I've seen from this game either."
Jingwen Chen,1,2025-09-28 00:27:59,"You shouldn't play Clash Royale if you're looking for a truly fair and balanced gaming experience, as the game heavily leans into pay-to-win (P2W) mechanics and suffers from notoriously unfair matchmaking. Players who spend real money gain access to overleveled cards and faster progression, giving them a significant advantage over free-to-play users"
Roohan Rana,5,2025-10-24 03:04:30,Game is severely Pay 2 Win but has no ads so it's a 5* for me. Mobile games these days are insanely ridiculous with the amount of ads that interrupt your game. This game could have easily introduced ads and props to them for not going down that route and actually having some form of customer care and acknowledging user experience.
Eli Marsten,3,2025-08-20 19:12:24,"One of the best mobile games ever made, would highly recommend it. However megaknight is way to overpowered with other troops and can't really be countered unless a negative elixir trade. Also this game seems to really suck at connecting to WiFi, somehow I stand in the middle of a city full bars even using WiFi and it manages to somehow disconnect. if these problems didn't exist I would say it would be the best mobile game or top three of all time."
Noah Whittington,1,2025-09-08 07:17:29,Its a good game but its such a cash grab you neither lose to people who buy the evolutions or just end up having to buy them yourself just to move up an arena not very fun anymore guys. Also the match making is rigged I was at 9979 trophy then went on 6 game losing streak like how supercell fix your game!
Okami (Doc),2,2025-08-19 10:26:50,"Used to play this years ago and quit because I didn't find it enjoyable I could face people with far more/better card options than me. That issue still seems present today, most of my opponents have either a higher or lower king tower level than me which means I'm either curb stomping them if they're lower or being curb stomped if they're higher. I'm 3 ""levels"" away from even reaching a higher level king tower myself so clearly they have a far higher average level amongst their cards."
Colton Terepka,1,2025-09-04 05:25:45,The game is too hard to make progress. Enemy team gains Elixir faster than you. Edit: came back to the game and it hasn't improved. In the side game modes the enemy is 10 times stronger than you. Tested it 50 times to be sure. This game will con you out of money. Pay to win is an understatement. They will make sure you have a horrible time unless you spend money. this is absolutely ridiculous and I hope that the creators of the game get prosecuted
Alex Porras,1,2025-09-16 19:27:50,"After reaching out higher arenas the game match-making it's just pay to win, I had the tower at lvl 11, and it constantly put me with people with lvl 14 and 15, with also lvl 14, 15 cards. So basically if you pay the game will keep you happy so you keep spending, and if not will frustrate you in order to make you pay. Ggs, #business"
Jouini Hichem,1,2025-09-29 21:26:35,"Clash Royale has gone from fun to frustrating. What was once a balanced strategy game is now pure pay-to-win. Updates focus on pricey offers and overpowered cards locked behind endless grind or cash. Each return shows worse balance and less fairness. Unless you’re ready to spend heavily or wait forever, expect disappointment. Nostalgia is the only thing left"
MR Quacky,5,2025-09-14 05:44:21,"This game is very fun, but like at the cost of p2w (pay to win). The amount of thinks you can buy in this shop and for the price is wild.Like a normal player would have to take years to grind but oh swipe my credit card and now i have it in under 1 minute of playing the game.But you start to counter them the better you get.Rest in peace to the new players."
Caleb Oliffe,1,2025-10-27 03:35:38,So p2w. as soon as u win a couple games and have fun u go on a massive losing streak. Don't get this game for the sake of your mental health. All supercell does is remove things for free to play players to make it more pay to win so they get more money.
Mohammed Ahmed,2,2025-09-30 09:11:49,the game is amazing and funny but the most trash thing about this game to be honest is that you should pay to have the most fun like really? I am tower of level 12 and u make me play with a tower level 13 and cards with level 14 ! how is that should be fair ? and that is the most part I hate about this game and each time I install it to have fun I then come back to delet it after playing this rounds with an opponent with higher towers and cards just because he paid to gain more upgrad and chests
John A.,1,2025-09-12 07:57:37,"The early game is fun when you can duke it out with other free to play players with common and rare cards that feel fair and are still fun. When you get up to the higher arenas it feels like I can't even play some of my favorite cards without just losing instantly to overbearing legendaries such as mega knight and goblin machine. Supercell, please give back the shop where f2p players can earn evo shards."
Tawby,1,2025-10-07 04:03:36,Even after putting hundreds and even thousands of dollars in all those Supercell games! They can still PERMANENTLY delete your account if you don't log in for an extended period of time.. Are you kidding me ? I would understand if it was a level 5 account or a F2P account.. but the fact that you deleted MY account for no other reasons than that is actually wild. Bunch of thieves.
Mohamed Skander Sidia,4,2025-11-04 01:04:33,"One of the best mobile strategy games that I have tried so far. there is just a bug it seems with the last update , when I launch a merge game , the game crashes."
1-z4c_w4s_h3r3,3,2025-10-12 07:25:11,"Very addictive game. I have a few complaints however. I have been hardstuck in sanctuary garden for about 3 months now. More specifically, 6500-6825 trophies. It is VERY infuriating. Pleeease nerf more cards and balance things out more"
Levi Langs,3,2025-08-13 15:50:50,personally I love playing this game but I hate the entire concept of the card levels. I also hate the if you win a game you get 30 and if you lose you lose 30 I think it should be like 30-20 instead. amazing gameplay but with the addition of broken cards to the point that if you not using it you just lose makes me put 3 stars instead of 5
Rydene Rodriguez,1,2025-09-19 22:04:12,"Unbalanced, pay to win, and not a fun game to play when the matchmaking is terrible. Matching up with players with PASS ROYALE proved that this game is pay to win. It has so much potential to be balanced, but it's been years and no action has been taken upon it."
Casper Urban,1,2025-10-08 16:31:14,"Rigged matchmaking to make you win a few rounds to keep playing. Then you're matched with someone who is pay to win. Generally the entire game is pay to win to be real, the hell are these evolutions? it doesn't seem fair to have a cannon that literally fires projectiles all over the arena. Games gone to hell thanks to these evolutions and a hellish amount of people can agree with that. Not to mention the random new troops surfacing left right up down, little prince? The Frankenstein guy? Weird."
Yodheen Baijnath,3,2025-10-02 03:51:48,"The game has improved a lot from the trash state it was in for the last few years. while still very pay to win, progression seems possible again and more enjoyable. performance issues still remain though. My game takes ages to load inbetween matches using my S20 ultra or S24 FE. I've had this issue for years and it is slowly getting worse. I'm pretty much unable to rematch in 2v2 and have to restart the game most times to keep playing."
Jackson Cable,3,2025-11-03 14:42:28,"It's a good fun game but your ""family-friendly"" settings are ridiculous I left my clan for a little bit but when I tried to rejoin I was blocked by this 16+ family-friendly setting so I can't access my family(very good) clan."
Roman Sanchez,3,2025-09-23 05:18:04,"This is a really fun game, but there is one problem that made me not care if I win or lose. So it's all fun when you have your deck and win a lot, but then as you go in the meta changes. I have changed my deck 5 times in a day, and that's just because I had a bad deck at that many trophies but then a good one, and it just kept going back and forth. to the point where I was just making the most random decks and not careing if they were good. PS Bring brawlstars back it's way better. he he he ha!!"
ŁØƓ ௱ΛらŤƐ尺,2,2025-10-20 11:11:56,"So,I like the game a bit, but, something that kinda ticked me off, is that i spent a few weeks getting gems, just to accidentally buy an emote. funny thing, you cant refund an emote 🥲. so, aftet all of that work, i get an electro giant foibt pointer fingers. an emote that i will NEVER use. (supercell, please for the love of god, add it to where you can refund emotes fron the past 30 days, or less) 🙏🙏🙏🙏"
tzee jaan,1,2025-11-05 01:08:16,"Better cards means higher win rates, pay to win game. Well good job on the muting part. Still bad mm system, very disappointing that a big company can't improve their mm system. (1/12/2018) Took part in the ""elixer capture challenge"" went up against 3-4k trophy player while I'm at 2k trophy. Good to see the mm is still consistently trash (23/11/2020). Lost my previous account, started a new one went up against an opponent with 2 tower level higher than me (05/11/2025)."
Aditya Sarkar,1,2025-11-04 16:22:02,"absolutely horrible game. it has become a ""pay to win"" game. The matchmaking is so flawed that you're subconsciously being forced to buy cards to level up and actually have fun."
Drake Crawley,1,2025-10-01 00:43:02,"its 2017 Awesome it is the best game I've ever played its now 2019 and its still one of the best games I ever played it's now 2021 and still my favorite mobile game, it's officially the last quarter of 2025 and they have ruined the game its terrible they remove things that people love when there's no reason things play well and besides a few balance changes the game should have been left alone but the adding and rearranging of gamemodes has finally killed the fun of the game after 10 years"
joshua jrb,1,2025-09-02 11:03:05,it used to be fun but now if you dont enjoy spending money on the game and still losing because the servers are always lagging then dont play this. they released new evolution cards which did infact change the game however if you want to play these cards you either need to get insanely lucky or cough up 16 dollars. new cards would be released and within 24 hours some dude has it maxed out and you cant win as these cards always come out over powered.
Moroni Fernandes,1,2025-10-12 22:03:55,"I hate this game, you ""supercell"" managed to destroy the game, just play everything at once and you can't hold it. You managed to make a good game horrible, you are incapable of making something good, keep putting ridiculous cards in the game."
Brian McGarvey,1,2025-11-04 10:02:57,"I have been playing this game off and on for several years. I upgraded my stuff by actually playing the game (6k wins). Unfortunately, like most games, this is a pay to win game and 90% of players use an evo mega knight or an evo pekka which are so unbalanced that its comical"
RJ BUnNy,2,2025-10-21 22:06:20,whenever the new update comes. too many bugs and glitches also come. one more thing if you guys add open mic it could be great for players. to talk with each other during gameplay.
Shehan Hetttiarachchi,4,2025-10-03 21:48:59,"In the new game mode ‘Merge Tactics,’ I noticed something strange. When I finish in 4th place and get knocked out early, the game already shows me who finished 1st, 2nd, and 3rd — even though the match is still going on. How is that possible? Does the game decide the winners as soon as the match starts?"
TG MIKOTO SNIPER,1,2025-10-27 21:07:02,"In old time was a great game but now a total garbage the opponent level how tf do this matchmaking happens my king level is 11 and I get freakin 13 opponents in clan wars and trophies like what do you think I should do when their cards are 15 and mine are 12 my all elixir is wasted defending their one card and they drop 2 more😡,at the very least do it so the opponent's king level can be only a single level higher then we have the chance to beat them"
Markelin Brushtulli,1,2025-11-02 06:43:22,8 year play here. it's not the same as it used to be legandaries felt legendary not common. 1 elixir skeletons spawns more then the 3 elixir skeleton army...game is being wrung out like a wet towel the only problem is the towel isn't wet. edit october 2025 evaluations are now changing the way thr game plays and it's just not the clash royal it used to be anymore.
Crossaltar,1,2025-10-15 05:37:53,"I've been Playing since early 2016 and like I'm playing this game because my bro is getting into it but in all honesty it's another paid to win bs games. If I haven't spent at least 30 to 100 for an evolution, battle pass, and card vouchers their is 100% that I ain't winning. It's just so repetitive and annoying to play this game again knowing that ""oh look another battle pass with evolution cards that can still kick the meta out"
Darryl Cembal,2,2025-09-21 04:28:09,this is a fun game but it has the absolute worst match making of any game I have ever seen you are constantly playing people who are higher level than you whichnin some games is fine in this the advantage is wild as every thing they use is also of a higher level that what you are using ... this would be fine in a new game with few players but thos game is not even sort of lacking in player so that it continues to be this awful is unacceptable
Joseph Trepanier (LowkeyLoki),1,2025-09-24 15:37:55,"COMPLETELY PAY TO WIN. you CAN make it to 5000-5300 Trophys I have hit a barrier where I make it to 5400 and then the matchmaking puts me against people who are 2-3 tower levels higher and don't get me started on the card leveling, I will have a level 12 Pekka and they will have level 14-15 so mine dies purely because its not hugh enough, honestly im at the point where I'm not gonna grind until I can dump $200-300 dollars into the game to just to enjoy it, and at that point is it worth it?"
Ayush Paigude,3,2025-08-25 13:02:03,"Please remove evolutions. The game was good before evolutions. Also, the golden cards option is starting from level 7. It was good when the cards would turn golden only after maxing out. Also add friendly battles for merge tactics."
Stephen Jackson,3,2025-10-27 00:03:16,"The UI stutter is getting me, and animations after battle. Also when tabbing around in main menu. kinda making me want to quit. Edit: I'm noticing when my keyboard opens to send a clan mail, it lags open. If my clan mates stop playing, I will too. Where's the optimization? There's no love put into this game, just a cash grab. Update: Performance still sucks."
Trenton Hayes,1,2025-09-06 09:56:13,"I re-downloaded the game after 2 mounths... pay to win get slam,Ed with 30 dollar offers and bad mackhmakeing my first games, losing to overpowered evos from offers and deals. all my old gems and coins? worthless. the event tab isn't even there anymore, and all the good stuff is locked behind a paywall. Progression feels impossible, also most carts aren't even fair they to way to much damage. The ga,e overall has fell of now science they removed the more fun ways to progress like season shop."
Reegan Eleazar,4,2025-10-10 22:34:28,"⭐⭐️⭐️⭐️ – Great Game but Needs Fairer Trophy Losses Clash Royale is one of my favorite games ever! The gameplay, cards, and strategies are super fun. But losing 30 trophies every time you lose a match is just too harsh — especially when it’s because of lag or level mismatch. It would be way better if losing only took 15 trophies, or scaled based on how close the match was"
Mr,3,2025-10-21 20:47:37,"this Merge Tactics mode are sucks so bad , RnG is sucks at top , the lagging is sucks at top , when first time its release it is very good , but for somehow it become sucks overall and very laggy , eventhough in different connection , sigh the mode"
Edo Marko,1,2025-10-01 12:15:26,"A very exciting game, but unfortunately it is very unfriendly to F2P players where the gap in card levels and evolution cards with opponents is very large, causing an imbalance between P2W and F2P. Also fix your servers for the Asian region, they're very unstable, making this game even more annoying. Players leave because of the card imbalance in the game, don't let them leave because of the service to. bring back the shop seasons to, mystery box rate is very trash. DON'T BE TOO GREEDY"
Ligma balls,1,2025-09-22 11:20:22,"I've never played a worse game in my life if you've been playing for long enough you'll have card people won't get until end game making it impossible to make any real progress, I've been playing for 3 years and I've literally never been able to get pat stage 11, sure there may be skill involved but literally every single person I play against has a card thats atleast 5 stages away from me"

Matthew Muroski,1,2025-09-24 01:14:41,this game is really bad it used to be good but now there are people who make new accounts and spend 300 dollars on the game and easily win. if they want to make the game good remove all micro transactions People can only have one account and levels can direct where people need to be. I am so close to deleting this game since it's not fun people with 15000 crown can just make a new account and play in arena 1 and decimated people who are new to this game.
Anton Whitehill,2,2025-09-03 22:32:53,"clash Royale support is useless and doesn't actually help you, it just gives you an AI bot while not actually acknowledging the issue. I lot my account and was trying to get it back , failed cause of this issue but weirdly enough brawlstars cares enough to look into things and gave me my account back. not to mention how P2W this game is. levels are everything and your not getting past level 11 without years of grinding, OR that sweet sweet 🤑🤑🤑 that clash cares so much about. still fun somehow"
Akif H,1,2025-09-18 12:49:34,"this game is alright at best. literally everyone I play against has at least 2-3 cards way higher in level than they should be. this company is money hungry like I have never seen before. playing a single game is like being sentenced to life in prison. supercell Balance your game, it is out of control. this game went from being remotely fun to litterly causing me to go into insanity spasms mid game. this game is horrible if I could I would leave a -5 star review"
Aseem Kunte,1,2025-06-30 22:03:53,"I've been playing since 2018 and used to love the game. After 2022 or so I felt that the developers wanted to do something to keep players engaged and i thought, ""oh they'll make it more skill-based, fair and fun"". But instead they made it more pay to win. Paying to win a strategy game makes no sense.. It would be cool if u can pay for skins (of the troops), towers, banners, stuff like that which doesn't affect gameplay. But instead they're like ""oh let's add level 15, totally not pay to win"""
Kamden Cornett,4,2025-09-29 18:56:19,it's an ok game it's just you have to pay to play. People who spend money on the game progress way more and if you say you give the f2p players in game events your wrong. Your voyage event was awful and the rewards was daily stuff. Also when are you finally going to nerf mega knight there are too many beatdown decks in this update
FiveFreddys,1,2025-10-22 07:27:17,"100 % Pay to win. If you refuse to spend money on this game, you will have a terrible time. Everything in this game is decided by how much you spend. Just remember, if you are a free to play gamer, u need to be a masochist. Because that's what the devs think you are, and thats how they treat you. A masochist."
Braulio Vega,1,2025-08-31 00:07:04,"Horrible. It's like every single update they make is carefully designed to screw over its playerbase even further. Broken cards, unnecessary nerfs, and removing features that had no reason to leave. If you aren't willing to use your credit card for everything, do not play this game. Also, Add back season shop."
J. Kevin,3,2025-10-18 02:19:14,"its a nice game to play between classes or on break, but its very, very hard to reach high trophies as a free to play player. ive always been free to play and i reached 10000 trophies after 3 months of grinding from 5000. the matchmaking is very unbalanced. if you arent ready to spend a fortune on this game, dont go into it expecting to be a top player."
Khushi,1,2025-09-22 17:07:14,"game is amazing, pretty much everything. except one major flaw. WHY AM I GETTING LEVEL 14 PLAYERS WHEN I AM 10. please change somthing and make it better. it's totally useless.. it's not possible for me to win at that moment. please fix it somehow ik it's an old issue.. but I might have to quit atp.."

Ethan 1,2,2025-08-21 23:11:44,"Was once an amazing game that was a little bit of a money grab. Friends rejoined the gaand I remembered my glory days on Clash Royale, so I had to re download. Opened the game and started winning until I ran into the first player using Evos. They are a busted pay to win tactic that ruins the game. I would be winning using strategy like I believed the fame intended until the opponent finally gets the evo used in their deck, and then I get rolled. A bad addition to the game makes it unplayable."
PrimeRogueH,1,2025-10-11 08:58:28,"Bad, because like even if they just spend a tiny amount of money, they already get a huge boost in power compared to f2p players like me. I came across player with a deck consisting of level 13 cards in electro valley, and my high level card is 11 even though it seems like a 2 level gap, remember I said a DECK consisting of level 13 I had one card at level 11. I love this game but it's so unenjoyable when you came face to face with a player who spent money to level up and get better cards"
Alex,1,2025-08-24 05:03:14,"Their strategy to get people to buy stuff is matching you against p2w players in trophy matches and event matches. For 2v2 they pair you with a teammate that either goes afk or has a spell only deck. They should be ashamed of these deceptive matchmaking tactics. Also, there is no feature to report afk players. Another strange thing is how there is a daily name reporting limit. I would understand if they had even basic filters to block inappropriate names, but people can easily swap characters."
Zeus Polecat,4,2025-11-01 05:26:05,"is a great game. controls really fit handheld touch screen. lots of modes to play. my only complaint is its so boring opening all the chests, I only bother to claim the shards now. I need to get an auto clicker and leave my phone to claim all. should be a claim all button"
Juan Bustos,1,2025-10-03 02:28:07,"after the recent update, i have not been able to log in to my account. Every time i open the game, it immediately closes.

Raffaele toscano,1,2025-08-24 18:58:17,"pay to win, with trash match makings, people with 3 levels more than you at the same arena, you can buy everything in the shop, the buffs and debuffs are made randomly and everything is expensive, there's no true competition, it's about the cards and levels you have, the game used to be good but now it's unbalanced and p2w, trash"
anthony young,1,2025-09-27 06:40:41,"garbage waste of time dont believe the hype. It is a very much pay to play which would be ok I dont mind spending money, the issue is the algorithm that controls the match making. if its your time to lose no matter what you play or do change your deck does not matter you lose. it will slow your elixir making down so you can't defend or attack as fast as your opponent. I am level 11 fighting level 9 all my cards are 11s their's level 8s and 9s and still lose. but then win time and you win 8 inrow"
Joshua Smith,1,2025-10-30 01:55:32,"you got to balance your game better, I did a test and 200 matches played 173 of them had either mega Knight or hog in it. or both but you have to understand you have made the game require no skill, just bridge spam the same 2 cards and put very low cost cards to cycle to them.... you have self destroyed your own player base.... stop changing how the boxes open and start fixing your darn game play"
Ermin Sabic,1,2025-08-19 23:19:53,"Stop deleting reviews that are true about your game not being good. I wouldn't download this game to play unfair matches every time, including merge tactics, and games against others who probably bought better cards with money and against people with higher towers and higher leveled cards making it hard to win, and go to the next arena, I wouldn't download this game and waste my time if I were you. It is just a pay to win game because it gives advantages to the people who payed over who didn't."
Harry,1,2025-10-30 16:22:06,"The game is stuck on 75% and the updating screen. I have seen multiple people with this error please fix it. I have tried everything, clear cache and storage, restart device and I uninstalled the app but still nothing. Supercell please fix this error."
Shivansh Tyagi,1,2025-10-20 15:40:24,how tf y'all manage to put the game in maintenance break and provide an estimated time which is not at all accurate and is misleading. Can y'all not have an update timely? I don't even play that often but whenever i open it out of 5 times 3 times it's in maintenance. Pathetic.
Jonathan Aurelius,1,2025-09-25 22:03:24,"So bad it's not even worth it, everytime you win there's going to be a pay to winner, with some dum cycle don't recommend if you don't want your phone to be broken and also, if you're on a winning streak, you will lose 1 time but then if you play again and again you will still use whether you're good or not and also Clash royale, nerf the vine spell it's so op that it's cheating and also, the people who come up with these ideas, hire new ones your game is just a p2w game and, worse than EA games"
Marc Hendrickx,3,2025-11-04 00:14:19,Since this season starting a merge tactics game makes the game close. The game will then only launch again after the match has been lost and you can return to the main menu.
SPUNK MISERABLE,1,2025-10-04 00:39:07,"This might possibly be the worst game I have ever played in my entire life. I have never had less fun playing a game than when I play clash Royale. I would genuinely rather play Hello Kitty, my island adventure, than even look in the general direction of clash Royale. This game is so inconceivably bad that it makes me genuinely reconsider even being born. I think I'd have a more enjoyable experience cutting both of my arms off with a rusty spoon than playing this game."
Alex Painter,1,2025-10-22 20:44:58,"Multiple times this thing keeps happening where my game freezes, no connection thing shows up, internet is fine on my phone told the support thing multiple times over the last 2 months about it but not even fixed it."
A Clark,2,2025-10-27 05:13:16,"Just can't, there are entirely too many elixir cheats/hacks being used. When you actually save elixir to 10, you place a 4 elixir card, then your opponent immediately places a 6 elixir card, 4 elixir card then 3 elixir card at the same time. Then magically is able to place an additional 4 elixir card. Come on."
Joey Slankard,2,2025-08-15 03:49:27,"this game is fun, but the problem is people that spend money on the game. I love playing it and it's fun, but it ruins the mood every time you play against someone with maxed out cards in area 10 make it not pay to play and maybe some people would play it."
Atharv Katiyar,2,2025-09-30 22:43:34,"The game is good but the only problem is with the internet 🛜 connection. It runs smoothly with the same connection during friendly wars and other times but at the time of the main war, it shows weak connection and hence couldn't use troops properly. Kindly look into it....."
a piece of toast,1,2025-08-19 07:32:32,"Actually one of the worst excuses for a mobile game I've ever seen, pay to win, unfair cards, horrendous matchmaking that they may as well not have, because everyone on this game is miserable, constant toxicity, and a theory of infinite elixir which I'm starting to believe as my opponents magically can play two 7 elixir cards in half a second during 1x elixir meanwhile I'm unable to play 2 cards with a combined elixir cost of 4 in 3x elixir, if you want to keep your sanity and wallet don't play."
Jake A,1,2025-10-20 04:38:04,"Honestly, this is the biggest time waster ever. The matchmaking is ridiculous and the cards especially in the ""events"" are broken. If you want to pull your hair out at people's luck and pay to win decks... go for it."
Jamari Mosley,5,2025-10-27 19:19:20,"Good game! Love the mechanics. The matchmaking is a little annoying, as you can get someone who is pay to win and has overleveled units. Other than that, good time waster. I recommend!"
Tommy Sartin,1,2025-09-02 02:01:27,Came back to the game and was having fun till I got to around 3500 trophies. Cant get anywhere past it and get put up against people who counter all of my cards every time without fail no matter what I do or how many times I switch things around in my deck. Very rigged and just a waste of time. Would not recommend any new player to waste there time on this game and find something else to pass the time. There is a reason why this game has so many 1 star reviews and they all are similar issues.
tino chen,1,2025-10-21 02:17:34,this game FORCES u to pay money to progress otherwise it's literally impossible to beat some of you might say you just need 'skill' but trust me skill isn't gonna save your pekka from a lvl 15 megaknight this game is genuinely HORRIBLE in balancing stuff and every update it keeps on getting worse and not to mention it's close to impossible to level up ur cards without SPENDING money don't bother playing unless u want to play who can spend the most money competition
William Johns,1,2025-09-03 13:42:30,it would be an amazing game if matches didn't have evolved locked behind pay to win. I understand people need to make money off of free games but this is redundant at this point you can't get card but one day at a time and yet you need better cards to make better charters. the old Royale was si much better at least it was balanced and not pay to win ....
babyhedgehog test,2,2025-10-01 03:16:40,"The units look so bad on PC when you send them out with a white border around them and they look really low quality. It ruins the immersive ness after seeing a 2D giant vs. on mobile a more realistic 3D version of the same giant... I would definitely give the game itself 5 stars, but the PC version really sucks, and it runs on the Google Play store soooo...."
Will Hughes,4,2025-08-15 21:38:33,I like this game it is pretty pay to win but fun IF you're willing to fork over 15 bucks for the clash pass.This game tests your quick thinking and problem solving (or not depending on your play style) Its also super addictive too. I also have some constructive criticism for the devs I think you should be able to get evolutions for 500 to 700 gems just to make it slightly more free to play friendly. So I give it 4 sneaky golems out if 5.
Dre Wipiti,1,2025-10-22 13:26:19,This game is terrible. The developers are just money hungry bums. removing everything helping free to play players. They worry about the stuff to to with money more than the actual experience of the game.
Emerson Dawson,4,2025-10-04 11:11:28,"The game is really good besides the pay 2 win aspect of it. You could be on lets say like a 10 game win streak and then you get matched up with some 5 year old who used his moms credit card to buy some kind of op card in arena 1. Overall, its really just the pay 2 win aspect and the 5 year olds with absolutley no skill that have exey in arena 2 thats bringing the game down"
Muave,1,2025-09-26 06:18:39,The entire game has come to a point where if you even want to compete you have to spend an absurd amount of money. New cards come out just to get nerfed immediately right after you spend $40 on the bundle. The developers destroy the game just to make money.
Rob Ollerdisse,1,2025-10-07 04:55:49,Game expects you to keep spending money with no reward. Made it to the highest level in the game and still getting beat by players several levels below me. Game is totally controlled. Supercell decides when and how you progress in the game. STILL GARBAGE... PC version is broke. Crashes constantly. Customer support keeps repeating their responses and is no help.
Peyton Koppy,1,2025-08-10 04:16:23,This game has become more pay to win than it has before. It is near impossible when I have mostly level 12 troops facing a team of level 14 troops at +7000 trophies. Everything is harder to upgrade because of the amount of gold you get so you have to pick and choose what you want to upgrade and can't try any other decks out because the other troops are under level compared to other people with the same deck.
Aidan Young,1,2025-08-22 14:11:27,This games matchmaking is designed to make you angry. they get your hopes up and let you get as close as possible to the next arena before pairing you with pay to win opponents for the next 5 games which leaves you back at the start. If a game is designed to make me angry to keep me engaged and to try and make me spend money then it's a disgusting games. Do not play this game if you want to enjoy yourself.
Jason Henke,2,2025-09-18 02:30:21,I can't stand losing 400 trophies anymore tried 20 other deck combinations and no matter what I always lose I've been playing this game for over 8 years and I can't stand the matching in this game and there's cards that obviously need a nerf and are to OP to counter. The pay to win is ridiculous too when I originally played i didn't have any good cards until arena 12 but let alone its not fun to play anymore its completely miserable
Andrija Kružić,1,2025-10-29 05:12:00,"Just Horrible! A month ago or so,I hit 10 000 trophies and I thought to myself,ok it will be similar as the previois games,but no,I am being bombed by bots where YOU CAN'T WIN,making it harder to get to 15 000 trophies,so please Supercell,fix this BS."
David Michael,1,2025-08-30 04:20:58,"very rigged and pay to play game. too many overpowered bots once they hook you by making it super easy to advance (at first). Do not spend money or the game gets harder because they know you'll spend money to advance. one of the most ""rigged"" games in the store. It's fun but frustrating. play only if you don't get triggered easily."
0o050o0,5,2025-10-06 01:35:31,My favourite game! Been playing it for like 9 years since the beginning. Have my clan since then! Have co leads with me from the start! Strategic! Fun!! Exciting! Great visuals and its just the best of the best!
rtr,4,2025-11-02 17:06:17,"Very good strategy game. However, P2W is a big problem when playing trophy road. Most cards are balanced (except for P.E.K.K.A and Sparky) so this makes them worth their elixir."
Asma Akter,4,2025-09-27 13:48:40,"This game is fun. At frist this game will be easy, but after you will enter a stage where you will see pay to win players. That stage is so hard but after you finish that stage, thinks will be get easyer. 1 tip, just dont give up!"
Sujay,1,2025-10-15 13:35:26,"Need an honest review? If you’re not spending money on this game, you’ll experience unfair matchmaking. Your opponents will often have much higher-level towers and cards than you. While the game is free to download and play, fair play comes at a cost and you’ll need to pay money to satisfy Supercell’s greed."
Gabriel Acosta,1,2025-09-07 19:50:41,"This game is so pay 2 win. You could be in the first arena of this game and still be going against an enemy that has everything maxed out. It really takes the fun out of this game when it's obvious you are losing. It takes the bare minimum amount of skill to play a whole maxed out deck in any arena below 10k trophies. The game is also somewhat luck based where you can get overpowered items from ""lucky drops"". This review is here to say that it's a horrible experience for people who don't spend $"
Loic U-King IM,1,2025-10-13 19:39:04,"The creator of this game needs an award in stupidity as his game is undeniably one of the worst and most unbalanced games ever. In trophy road, my opponent will always have cards which are higher level than mine aswell as towers which are higher level aswell In merge tactics, I never get the cards i need meanwhile somehow my opponent has gotten 2 3 stars in only 2 rounds Even worse, I played against people who had decks which required way more elixir than my deck and yet they suddenly get 7x"
Jefferson Phan,1,2025-10-12 02:50:36,"This game is unplayable without spending money because all interactions are heavily skewed in the direction of those who spent money on the game, I don't recommend this trash to new players due to the lack of f2p in the game."
Larry Noon,5,2025-09-02 23:28:22,"Game can be really slow. If you get really high on trophies, if your like me it gets hard to tap on the battle button on fear of losing your trophies. There needs to be a game mode to play all the time and still getting rewards for it. Limited game modes are fun and all, but once you use your free entry, it's like u have to spend like 5 dollars just to lose again."
Alex,3,2025-10-06 03:28:36,this game is amazing before they made p2w a must to advance.in fact i will break down the progression of ladder.(0-2000 trophies)barely any pay to wins so its quite fun here.(2000-3000)still fun.(3000-7000)where people unlock megaknight which means they will spend at least half their life savings just to get it.(7000-10000)where 99% of people have maxed level 15 cards when you are stuck with level 13s.
Owenn Skulski,1,2025-10-03 02:42:45,"Unless you drain your wallet for evos and card levels, this is one of the most unfun games you can get, it's free and I still feel ripped off. I've been at 9000 trophies for a month, and I grind this game everyday because apparently 10k is a status symbol and it gets better then. This feels like an ubisoft game."
Oliver Skewes,1,2025-09-20 16:12:14,"Although the game says it is free, it is literally impossible to play without spending money. This game is the product of pure greed, making the game as depressing as possible for its free to play players so that one day they may spend money on the game to reach an ounce of enjoyment. But sadly the only Supercell employee to read this will have no say in what happens in this game. By the way, how's your day? Sorry I now feel bad."
byolo gamer,1,2025-08-13 15:58:40,I wt from a really good game to play each day to the worset p2y game of all time like I do not understand how a company could make game bad then turn it into great then bad again I don't get it at all. Advise for new players I have been playing this game for almost 9 years completely F2P and I still not lvl 15 (I quit around 2019 till 2020 I lost a lot progression there) If you want to enjoy the game buy every offer . Not recommended any more👎👎👎
Yahir Guzman,1,2025-10-25 09:34:49,"downloaded Clash Royale thinking it would be a fun little strategy game. What I actually downloaded was a rage simulator cleverly disguised as entertainment. Every match starts off fine — I drop a Knight, they drop a Knight — but five seconds later I’m watching my towers crumble under a level 15 Mega Knight while my poor Level 11 cards are out there doing moral support at best. Let’s talk about the matchmaking system, shall we? It’s like the game sees I’m having a good day and decides, “Nope,"
Szymon Krzyszczuk,1,2025-09-06 01:22:48,"There's nothing better than waking up in the morning and opening this game to play for fun just to play against SIX different people IN A ROW, playing THE SAME card!!!!! If it wasn't for mega knight, my games would actually be fun and enjoyable! but no! They are nothing short of reducing my brain to mush because of how easy it is to play that stupid card! If only my life was as easy as those helmet wearing mega knight players! God does this game bring me so little joy all because of ONE CARD!!!"
Sam Elvin,3,2025-10-19 06:11:53,"used to be great but it's so pay-to-win nowadays that it's basically unplayable if you don't want to spend all your money getting your troops to max level. The matchmaking could be a lot better, me and nearly everyone I know struggle if they're in mid ladder, nearly entirely to do with our enemies entire decks being 2 levels higher, so matchups dont work and elixir trades are always detrimental. if they fix this then it would defo be much higher"
Yogi Osama,1,2025-09-01 21:21:39,I was around 14000 traphy. after today's update. they took me down to 11700. why the hell they do this... check this bug... it is un ethical. I gave my time to this game. that's not the way... is anyone there who can solve this problem or I should leave the game along with my 1500 friends playing this game
Humble 2,3,2025-10-19 13:51:40,"has INSANE potential, and is completely RUINED by the insane pay to win system. I know this review wont change anything about the game, but i can say this to people wondering if they should play, the answer is yes. Just know its going to be infuriating, happy clashing."
LKunhackable,3,2025-09-09 22:06:37,"I really enjoyed this game until today, I almost got to a new arena, and I was 1 win away. I lost and lost and lost. I lost 5 games in a row, and now I am 6 wins away. I don't know about others, but if Supercell don't wanna lose players, they should fix matchmaking and make it easier for people to reach a new arena. The reason I'm so upset is because I have only 40% chance of winning (I calculated it). it seems to be a lot harder to win at the end of every arena. (happens all the time)"
dyge nega,1,2025-09-29 19:28:57,I am in arena 12 and still have yet to get an evo since I refuse to spend money on a free game. the game seems to want to punish me for that fact and put me against 3 people using a hyper leveled boss bandit and multiple other cards that aren't accessible in that arena. This game is too pay to win for any kind of interaction to feel enjoyable.
Devin,1,2025-09-28 04:02:05,"i had a supercell id, lots of data, evolutions and most cards in the game, I got a new phone, logged in with the same account, instead of having lots for trophies and other stuff that I had, it removed all of it, and now I have less then 10 and all my previous stuff gone, because of supercell id and how stupid it can be, been trying to get it back, but no it won't let me"
alex curtis,1,2025-09-20 20:03:43,"redownloaded this game after a couple years and its kind of pathetic how far down they've plummeted in quality. they add new kinds of cards with kind of bogus abilities, all just to play 2 6 hog cycle every other game. what happened to a classic game that simply rewarded good timing?"
Abdul Kalam,1,2025-09-14 17:14:20,"Good gameplay, sad matchups cuz it's of course pay to win model. The more you subscribe to the game pass, the better matchups you get. Skill was somewhere lost in updates. Sadly uninstalling it forever. Bye!"
Mike Brensinger,1,2025-10-10 10:08:43,"Started out as a great game, but greed has over taken the spotlight, now experience has nothing to do with it and strategy is all but non existent, sad that they allowed greed to be deciding factor!!! If it weren't for my grandson I would delete. Not sure why I still play, guess I am hoping that experience wins again, but that just seems to be a dream becoming more and more disappointing!!!"
Jacob Springer,1,2025-09-05 04:54:54,"if you are trying to make money again fix the algorithm so winning is possible more than 5% of time, and oh same with the royalty yellow cards 95% I get one that I dont need over and over and over and over. for the rarest cards in the game its almost abusive to the consumer. I used to love playing the game but now it just fills me with rage most times and is no longer enjoyable to play. please fix"
Gabe Smirl,1,2025-09-27 21:16:22,"levels are everything, don't be fooled by the free download, it's impossible to compete without paying for any in app purchases. and the frequent updates boosting 1-2 cards so much that you HAVE to have them in your deck, but also making sure that it's evo so you have to pay for it makes the game genuinely painful to play. Just save yourself your time because it's also extremely addictive."
Kaizer,3,2025-10-22 11:30:56,"it would be SO GOODAMAZING even if you just added more ways to get cards, once you reach a high enough arena it isn't even about skill anymore, it's either you have evos or overleveled cards. genuinely how do you even get evos? i have like 2 shards im at 5k trophies and almost all of them have evos, if not they'll have lvl 14 cards. evos are such a big part of the game now and getting them without money seems impossible. Fun but heavily pay to win until your highen for evry1 has the sm levels"
JayVeeL,2,2025-09-28 14:12:08,"I swear the game throws you hard counters on purpose and pay to win when you're about to reach the end of an arena, then people spend 12 elixir if 5 seconds when your barley getting 3 elixir at the same time. then you'll get someone with 2 over powered evos, the game itself is fun but it's pay to win and everything else I mentioned"
Dimitrios Venidis,1,2025-10-21 15:18:26,"all of a sudden, my account is lost. I cannot login into my account. system is telling me that sends email with verification code but 3 days now I'm not receiving any"
Ant Kehoe,2,2025-11-04 03:56:48,"fun but some problems we need an exit button during battles, it's very annoying when you want to leave but just cant also make a report button when your battling people, because I've came across a lot of toxic and mean people"
L增,1,2025-10-27 20:43:41,"good to play, but recently I always experience lag/dc in combat with wifi, It is not reasonable for this kind of games. bad experience. happen 10 and above times a day. force to close and play another time"
Brandon Geltner,5,2025-08-18 06:49:07,I played this game for 2 years and was addicted to the game. It was very fun to play. I also spent a little money from time to time. Over the past few months supercell messed up and made the game p2w. Then came lvl 15 and evos. The game suddenly went from pay 2 win to pay 2 play. The game is not fun to play right now and supercell needs to make the game more f2p friendly.
DeVante Hoschette,2,2025-09-13 07:39:22,stopped playing years ago cause of the grind. the grind is easier now than it was but it seems the cheater problem has gotten massively worse? it's getting really annoying losing so many trophies from someone playing 15+ elixir worth of troops when I've played 5 elixir worth of it. I had 3 in a row this morning. I also don't understand why losing in sudden death by 3 HP nets me the same loss of trophies as I gain for triple crowning in the minute and a half. really makes the trophy grind awful.
Ali Jamalullail,1,2025-09-05 17:31:07,Finally started playing this game after like 4 years and realised how pay to win it has gotten. Every match u play will have people with cards from 2 arenas higher than you and their levels will be absurd and impossible to defend. It's just sad how low this game has fallen. DO NOT PLAY!
Jack Meyer,4,2025-08-30 09:50:14,"I mean the game is alr, it needs some few tweaks but with the Google play beya for pc. the 2v2 with my discord friend hits hella hard. it's also very nostalgic. like I love played when it was in its beta, and then kinda forgot about it. but now it's Really good. besides the PTW and other bs. I've known that since the beta though. hope this review is helpful! download the game if ya like predictions and skill in some parts."
Colton Long,1,2025-09-19 07:36:50,"The number of trolls and Smurf accounts is crazy I got to arena seven, and I can get past it. I'm not bad nor good at the game, but still lose 12 matches in a row. is crazy also this game is just a pay 2 win. it's not a game anymore. It's just a money grab n the game sucks now. It used to be fun before they made it a pay 2 win game. If I could rate it 0 stars, I would because it's a terrible game, and super cell needs to balance it"
Ezekiel,3,2025-10-13 06:07:37,"I really like the game but when I'm on my PC, my game crashed every couple minutes or every couple seconds, its gotten so bad that right when i open it, it crashes. I have no idea what to do about it"
Firas El husseiny,1,2025-08-30 22:25:31,"really, horrible support team. They never responded and always refer you to a bot. All they do is copy paste responses without even reading what you wrote. My account recently got hacked and i have tons of receipts to prove ownership but the support doesn't seems to care, I've tried in game support multiple times and all they do is make you wait or never respond at all. Please If you want a game that cares about it's loyal player base never download any supercell game."
Jaber Parvez,1,2025-10-31 20:33:45,After latest update this game is becoming trash day by day. Not loading properly. Hanging around on the loading screen for 30 seconds. Cards deploy getting delayed. I have stable connection. This game developers are becoming trash day by day.
TR Monaghan,1,2025-10-10 23:47:43,I'm free to play so everyone I face has way higher level troops. there's nothing I do about it. also sometimes when I start a match my game freezes and I so I have exit out and reopen the game and of course I loose.
Antovic 939,1,2025-07-01 07:04:31,"As an 8 years old player, the game has been unplayable due to the amount of offer in the shop, the chase that had been removed, the passroyale and the challenge that now don't give us any rewards. The progress is barely possible for me, so don't even think you would get new players supercell. The game is dying and fast. PS to the guy who designed the new badgets, this incredibly hideous. Fix your game by thinking about your players before thinking about money because everyone is going to quit"
Knight Waters,5,2025-10-09 09:01:25,"a very good game. I recommend you play it, though this one bug triggers every time that I go on to the collection screen, and, say I want to see the details for a tower troop card that I want and I hope to unlock. it will just crash the game and it's annoying. so please fix that supercell. it's still a very good game."
Andrea Castillo,5,2025-10-17 06:06:21,The game is great in general it's really competitive and it will help you control your stress even if you're under pressure. additionally I will really recommend this game if you want to spend time. But I always have a problem with this glitch I can't see if my mutuals are online and I'm upset about it because I can't play against them which is also what I enjoy playing with. I already checked if it was the Internet and it wasn't. so I would really appreciate it you can fix this please and thx!
Atom Troncoso,3,2025-09-21 02:32:15,the game is so fun no adds and u can still win even with our paying its amazing but to be honest I went against people that spawned in units over the elixir limit which means they can't do that I can't tell if its a glitch or their cheaters and also if ur thinking to get the game get it but its a 70% chance u will get very mad
Samson Thomson,1,2025-10-25 08:56:40,it sucks whenever you buy cards that you Spent your heart earned money on it doesn't even give you a good level gives you no way to upgrade it till you get to the arena with that card level 1 card that you can't use until you get to the arena that you can upgrade it it's not worth it and I would not recommend
Gnarly,1,2025-10-04 02:40:43,"Absolutely disgusting p2w. Forced to spend money to keep up with people right after training. Impossible to beat these guys. No matter what. They're stacked. I haven't even had time to figure out if I liked the game and I'm already pressured into spending. And if I don't, I lose every match. Or have to wait 12 hours for a chest. Not because of strategy, just purely unbeatable cards. Everything this company makes is a huge moneygrab. You've got to be joking me. This game is still bad 2025"
Jogn Withes,1,2025-08-25 13:53:12,I had to make a new account because I got stuck with 7 cards as soon as I ended the tutorial 0 support and stop putting things for .99 I cant use my dollar credits scale the rewards a lil better and put it for something over a dollar so I can just use my card to cover the rest
Brendan Robert's,1,2025-10-26 04:59:56,Update. why does my opponent have a troop that is 5 arenas higher than the arena im in. Like come on. What the frick am I supposed to do? update. I can get a 4 win streak of actual players. But then you shove a robot that has every card that goes against mine and are better. They also are placing more troops than the elixir they have. Can you not make your bots unbeatable.
Yuvraj,3,2025-10-05 14:45:28,"with the addition of evolutions, it has become an essential part of winning the game. The problem is, its extremely hard for f2p players to get evo shards. I have been playing for so long and I've never gotten a shard from a lucky drop. Never. So considering this, they give two evo shards if you complete the pass royale, so 3 seasons for one evolution? Come on supercell."
A,1,2025-08-19 23:34:01,"The loading screen is too much, I am not waiting for 2-3 minutes after every game especially when I am losing. And I am not talking about the loading screen when you start the app or after updates that $hit takes 10 minutes or more."
Jason Yan,1,2025-09-25 12:44:01,It was a fun game. Now with the new double evos only for lvl 15 it's impossible to actually win even if you are better as a lvl 14. This game has become p2w and super cell is disgustingly greedy. Edit (2025-09-25) This game is still horribly money hungry. Additionally the matchmaking will specifically put you in disadvantageous match ups so you keep playing. Supercell is shameless.
Carmen Diaz,1,2025-08-20 06:18:28,"Sometimes, it disconnects me for no reason. The elixer is really unbalanced and does unnecessary changes. I have this odd suspicion that it's all about what you buy in the shop and not actual skill."
Patrick Collins,1,2025-10-15 15:05:53,the match making on this game is a joke. how does someone that plays casually with not many legendary cards above level 8 or 9 get matched with someone that has legendary cards maxed out or almost maxed out and a hero that is 40 plus levels higher? if that was better the game might be decent at best. the drop rate on legendary cards is so rare that if you want to max out the better cards you have to spend money. play to win for sure
J E,4,2025-09-18 08:10:26,"it's a really good and fun game. But there's two issues for me personally, one is that it's really p2w. Like, if you go f2p on this game you occasionally might want to murder someone. Second is that this game is insanely dependent on really good and stable wi-fi. If your Internet drops by half a bar, you lost the match."
Bub Liverman,3,2025-09-27 00:56:13,"genuinely have an addiction to this game and can't go long without playing when im free. thay being said why can't I play the game properly on the latest android update? I have a year old phone and this version came out 2 years ago there's no way my phones ""old"" i have like 300 hours over the last 4 months alone and frfr wanna keep playing but input doesn't work right or at all on this version of android. i barely ever leave reviews, but maybe leaving this one will help? idk bruh"
Chase Correa,2,2025-08-22 10:24:30,unfortunately this game has become pay to win just like it's predecessor clash of clans. Dont have the cards you need for upgrade? Don't worry they sell them. Your castle defense is lacking? Don't worry they sell that! It used to be skill based but that time has come and gone. GG to the OG clash royalers it was fun while it lasted.
David Hutton,1,2025-09-09 13:55:03,it is a very bad game that's unbalanced and unmanaged. They pit you up against higher ranked players in an attempt to get you to spend money on the game. you cannot max out cards without paying for it.
Zach Sheton,1,2025-10-03 18:51:22,"I got the game again. I played for a long time a while back. when I started the tutorial I got stuck in it. I've done about 15 practice battles, and I still see that stupid hand trying to make me do another practice battle. I tried recovering my old account and it won't let me. I was willing to start over with new cards. but I still cant get past the tutorials."
A zz,1,2025-09-30 06:28:45,there is no way with the millions of players in this game that I somehow will always match up with counter decks. I've changed my deck multiple times when I bump up to next arena I play against the same decks 10 times in a row. I've been playing for 9 years
Omar Abed,1,2025-08-14 09:18:25,"So apparently, the system slows down your generating mana depending on who it wants to win. Yes, you might be able to overcome that by being lucky with your troops. However, after timing it in multiple games, the game is rigged. No need to get fustrated anymore my friends, the system has got it all planned out for you - just updated this again August 14 2025"
Jaafar Almukhtar,1,2025-10-06 23:26:52,"It's one of the worst apps and games I've ever played and used, you reach up to almost 15000 trophy and then they get you back to 11000 suddenly without any previous warning or notification, and you get nothing instead! you don't know why you're playing cause at any moment they will take you back to a one year before trophies! it's just nonsense..."
Graham Gifford,3,2025-08-22 00:56:08,well I play and win like two games then lose like 3 and then have to continue playing to get it back up and it almost took me a month to get out of an arena so yeah. also it can be really addictive so make sure to take breaks and know when to stop playing because in one day I spent like 7 HOURS on the game and I didn't even know it.
ryder program,1,2025-10-19 18:43:37,"Fix reconnecting in game. It's better to close and reopen the app then it is to wait for it to reconnect. Also, the clan war matchups are horrendously overleveled."
Lincoln Holliday,1,2025-11-03 17:26:01,"this game is so pay to win its crazy you can't go against anything fair anymore because evolutions have ruined the game, supercell has only made one good game and thats brawl stars at least in that game you have to have some skill I just went against lvl 10 peka, lvl 10 Royal recruits I'm being so serious don't install this game if you like having fun would not recommend"
Lord Boss4,1,2025-08-26 07:53:46,"if I could give a review lower than this I would, game has become basically every EA game, filled with p2w, you wanna play free to play? too bad, someone is gonna buy the best stuff they can, and every other match you go against someone who has spent 100 bucks on the game and has cards that aren't even unlocked for you yet cause they are arena 13 while you are at 9. don't play unless you have a thousand bucks spare."
Ali Can,1,2025-08-13 22:14:48,"The reason i gave it one star is because i didn't enter the progressive mode i used to play in a season, so they set a 15000 trophy limit. I've been playing the game since it was first released, but this move has ended the game for me"
Craig Tansley,1,2025-09-12 07:44:31,matchmaking algorithm is completely rigged. after 9 years of playing it's very obvious to me. it's getting extremely frustrating and not fun to play at all. I would not recommend this game to any new players.
Madeleine L,1,2025-10-01 15:40:41,Please make the round preparation time in merge tactics start faster and end wayyy slower in the final rounds. its impossible to mass sell and rebuy/upgrade if that's the play you want to do. all the animations take so long.
Jd Armfield,1,2025-10-13 07:48:09,"I don't recommend playing this game. Everyone plays the same tired old decks. Evolutions are pay-to-win, and cards are balanced horribly. Most of the time, it feels like rock, paper, scissors. If you don't have a counter to the opponents deck, then you lose and vice versa. Yes, you can win by playing meta cards and some skill, but playing the same cards and decks over and over is boring."
Abdollah Asim,1,2025-08-29 11:15:41,"It had become pay to win sinse a period I think like a year and half so for people like me who don't buy things , it became so hard most of my enemies are Lvl 14 and 15 by buying the royal pass. So is that I won't play it again it was the best game in my childhood, it was... worst game ever"
Nicklas Kristoffersen,1,2025-11-04 03:50:31,Can't even access the game. If it doesn't crash during startup it crashes during me loading into a match. This started after the latest update.
Avi Fecher,5,2025-10-25 21:36:26,its a fun game but quite pay to win however if you like strategic games that you can play on the bus or anywere really i think this is the game for you also its extremely rewarding which makes it more enjoyable.
K A I I,3,2025-09-10 19:15:10,"Help!! my game has stuck on updating and after some time it says network error. i tried clear cache, clear data,force stop, reinstalling and still not fixed. I missed many things because of that."
Nash,1,2025-10-31 00:08:31,If you install this game for the first time in 2025 you will forever be at a disadvantage. No matter how hard you try you will never have a fraction of what players had when the event shop existed.
Ryland,5,2025-08-17 15:08:06,"if you dont have the game. get it. I dont care how many people say it sucks or how they say its p2w or just luck. im still gonna play it and you should too. theres more to the game than placing things down its a strategy that you need to build on as you get better at the game. its not hard to level up cards or get wins. its a easy game to learn, has a fun concept, and will always have you coming back. great game 5/5. never fails to keep me entertained."
Nikunj Saini,1,2025-11-04 20:48:16,"They have just ruined the game beyond repair. IF YOU ARE A PLAYER THAT IS THINKING OF RETURNING, PLEASE DO NOT. Made this game absolute pay to win. Nothing at all for free to play players."
Federico Cigliutti,1,2025-08-14 20:08:48,"I hate this game, you spend time, resources and money to get your deck how you want it and then just when you do have something that is working, they go and nerf your troops because its too hard to counter it. every single time."
Vincent de Margerie,1,2025-09-20 20:05:15,"You play their game for year just to reach a pay wall at lvl 14 of 15 where you either need to pay ridiculous amounts of money to lvl up you troops, or you just can't help your clan in wars unless ALL you cards are maxed out to lvl 15. Clan war matchmaking needs a serious fix to be playable at all levels. It shouldn't be a thing that my clan leaders tell me to afk my games in clan wars to get only the base points for participating. Supercell, how greedy can you get... seriously. fix your game"
Brandon Ramirez,3,2025-10-26 03:19:38,This game is fun but 🫤 the bad part is that I keep getting player higher or stronger opponents then me even tho I have weak cards the enemies have hight level cards then me thats the bad part it would be more fair if I could go against people who have the same levels as me
Abhay,1,2025-08-31 00:44:27,"was playing everyday for 3 weeks now since the new update it says 75% or updating and doesn't load into the game researched and found out it's not just me but a lot of other people, really annoying urging supercell to fix this issue asap."
Sakha NK,2,2025-09-19 17:34:13,"Hear me out, the reward system is quite stingy. You must wait for 24 hour to get a new reward (free coins and chest). Which is will make it difficult for new players to make a significant progress. That's why it's kind of boring."
Chapina Alonzo,1,2025-10-07 09:55:22,"I like playing this game but right now it's not letting me in, keeps saying updating but stops and it's not my wifi so I'm not liking it at the moment.....once again it's doin something and I can't play the game, not my phone or wifi, says updating and then I need to log back in, already uninstalled 3x and still nothing."
James DMurdoch,3,2025-10-27 06:02:44,"horrible matchmaking, per usual. always getting paired with people who's tower levels are two more than mine and cards are 4 or more levels higher. worse than cod matching. card art is cool, clan things are cool but trophy road is HORRID"
Keaton Wright,1,2025-10-19 07:58:59,"I keep playing, hoping that it would be better but It slowly gets worse. this game also is a big pay to win game. I wish I could rate this game lower but there is a limit to how low i can rate it"
Lewis Wynkoop,1,2025-10-14 03:32:10,This game is terrible. If there were a 0 stars it would be that. You need a deck that can actually survive so you can't use cards that have low hp but if you use cards with high hp you can't defend. And the cherry on top is that there is no compensation for doing bad.
best friend,3,2025-09-01 13:11:08,I hate every time that I lose to a pay to win loser because they have way better cards and it's way easier for them to counter my deck because of higher level and they buy cards that you can't unlock if you're in a lower league there's nothing I can do to counter their deck they should add a feature where you shouldn't lose trophies to people who have higher level cards and people who paid for evos. I'm only on league 3 💀 and already battling people with evos but besides that the game is fun
JACK,1,2025-08-18 18:24:38,I absolutely hate how you made this game pay to win. Everything good was taken away and now we have to pay for it. Even the elite charge event is now 800 trophies where it was 500. It's like you are trying to ruin the game.
Isaac Alegria,1,2025-10-06 11:54:28,"I don't even feel like trying to play because they have taken out all the beginner friendly stuff in the game for money spending grind. Even the ranked mode has you go in with level 15 troops. I loved the ranked mode for its beginner friendly nature. If you had under leveled cards in the higher ladder, you could go on ranked and try on some new decks before you spent money on leveling up other cards or grinding for cards you know will work. Just because of that, I guess I'm uninstalling. Sad."
Tristin Perkins,1,2025-09-10 05:55:59,still play this game daily but its so pay to win its impossible not to get hardstuck in any given areana no matter your skill level due to people who have multiple levels higher than you in cards and towers edit: still same problem ive also ran into an issue with grinding where the game only incourages you to play 4 games a day because outside of the 4 chests you can get the pass takes forever to get with mid loot and the events are just bad and the game continues to push pay to win to the top
William Klinker,1,2025-10-30 08:28:03,"Supercell, your pay to win game has been killing me for the past 6 years. Why dont you try and actually fix how the game is played, and no I am not some kid that just lost all his trophies after being one win away from 10000"
Apx,1,2025-10-04 22:43:17,"Don't play this game, it's so horrible to progress in it because everything they do is a cash-grab. You cannot progress without spending money. Also, they could at least make Merge Tactics fun to play, but choose not to."
Kristupas Meskauskas,1,2025-09-01 15:32:03,"I've been playing for several years but all these new updates are really asking us to p2w, they removed many features that allowed f2p players progress so now I'm just stuck at an arena with underleved cards and the only way to fix that is by spending money. Fix your game Supercell!!!"
Kai Wymore,4,2025-10-08 17:39:11,"I get kicked out every 30 seconds, so sometimes it takes forever to do anything. Even when I have full bars. Fun game overall, like the cards and updates. Add more evos. Is p2w, so for me I don't pay, it makes it hard to advance arenas. I like the setup and how it works. I like doing friendly battles, because your towers have the same health. Makes me rage because I face p2w every other match or something. Love the game, play or a lot, add a new card soon. That would low-key be peak."
Joshua Wittcop,2,2025-08-21 15:31:38,"used to be an amazing game, but I refuse to spend money on this game and now that its pay to win it's not fun, boss bandit is absolutely ridiculous, and needs a nerf, Evolutions destroyed fair gameplay. so if you have a credit card and no need for money this is the game for you"
Nathan Facer,1,2025-10-23 14:03:55,"Used to be fun but its so incredibly pay to win now and card evolutions made it even more so. Insanely hard to get card evolutions without paying, not to mention card evos are very op so if you dont have good ones it is much much harder to win."
Freddie,4,2025-10-25 19:12:11,"the games peak, its obvs not perfect, no game is, its slightly pay to win, but its overall enjoyable, its a challenge but it keeps you focused, very good concept. pankakes innit"
Daniel Bonar,4,2025-08-03 12:34:01,"I've been playing for about 3 years now and i can say this is one of the best mobile games out there, no adds, and you can play without needing to pay. I highly recommend it however my only gripe with it is how it has slowly become more and more pay to win. If you do not pay you will have a hard time on ladder. The game has become flooded with low to no skilled player who buy cards and other items from the shop to think they are good and it completely ruins the game for F2P players."
Richard Mark,1,2025-11-02 03:30:55,Super Cell does nothing about all of the cheating especially elixire boost cheats going on in this game. People spend more real money to compete with all of the Cheaters. This game has turned into a Money grab joke and super cell doesn't deny it. Just look at the reviews. Dont waste your time or money..ITS A PAY TO WIN GAME THATS IT
mahad bashir,4,2025-10-16 23:09:49,"hey epic games i have been playing this game for about 9+ but the card upgrading system is very complex as it require lot of money so make an update in which we only need to collect cards and onward they get insatant upgrade. it will be great pleasure for all the consumers who have been playing this game .benefy ur consumer so that they dont leave in there disturbing life, moreover i hope u will act upon my opinion in this regard"
Ziv Anchel,1,2025-10-01 14:06:58,"If I could not go against hard counters that would be spectacular, in adition to that, why am I going up against level 15 players as a level 11 on my alt account, i'm already free to play. I can't stop playing the game, yet i've deleted it 27 times. this game is ok but on my main account it's cost me $700 in microtransactions and a phone. I'm hooked on the game like heroin, no matter how hard I try to stop playing, the new evo always has me putting in my digits."
Mr. Mayank,1,2025-08-31 06:23:53,"The most pay to win game ever created , if you're a new player thinking about starting this game please don't , you will never win a battle if you're one of the free to play people , every new update the meta changes and they buff something up and pay to win players have already unlocked a new evo and they have it maxed out you can't compete with that if you have not spent money on this game."
Josha,1,2025-10-05 22:21:24,Its the worst game i have ever played. The best card is the credit card. Imagine you invest 10k in this game. This is what most of my enemys do. Its impossible to win in 60 percent of the games cause your enemy paid more money than you. Only because the game is free in Play store doesnt mean its free ingame. This game is the perfect example why games get worse and worse each year...
Johnnyboi 21,1,2025-09-28 15:45:55,Horrible game absolutely pay to win game after the 6th arena everyone is 2 levels higher and then they have cards that are maxed out. Pure pay to win game. When you win one game it gives you barely any trophies but then when you lose it takes away twice the amount of trophies so you lose your mind this game is horrible and is for pay to win people so happily use your credit card that is the only way to win in this game. This game is buns takes 33 trophies then gives you 25 when you 3 crown someo
Kwstas X,1,2025-09-04 01:58:46,"The game is fine until you get passed arena 8. After this point the winner of a match is not the skilled one but the one who has spent the most money on this completely u balanced game. honestly, its just another pay to win game nothing special."
giant big,4,2025-09-29 22:04:52,"This is a STRATEGY game. If you can't play or don't understand what strategy means, it's not for you. Spending millions won't help if you lack strategic thinking. Money is not the key here—only inexperienced players think otherwise. You just need to focus and think smart. Commenting after 9 years of experience."
Terrance Oakley,1,2025-10-28 19:59:20,This game might be the single worst thing life has ever created. NO ONE plays to have fun nor does anyone have fun playing this game. You win 3 good in a row then you play severely over leveled players that loose you 6 in a row. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME
Ruben Vermaak,1,2025-09-28 01:31:10,"Been playing the game for 9 years and the past few seasons have honestly been the worst ever. The game is unbalanced, pay to win and the devs are useless and never listens to the community (2v2, season shop etc.) goodluck if you are f2p. Upadte it is now the 27th of September the game is still not fixed and the new update for October also does not show much more promise. My point stands the game is pay to win and the devs are cash hungry and has no intrest in improving the game but to make money"
Rajendra panda,1,2025-09-27 03:55:18,"This game will never let you win if you are a free player, no matter how good your cards are, the opponent can still beat you without any problem. And this is the case in both merge metrics and one on one battle. No wonder so many negative reviews."
Suriaya Parvin,4,2025-10-26 18:36:30,"Its literally the best game i had ever played in my entire life, but like the thing is most things like evos and others are literally in the item shop that cost real money making this a P2W game mostly. Would have been 5 star but i have to give u this, im sry"
David Hallmond,2,2025-10-15 17:36:19,#PayToWin I don't care if I get hate it's very true and you don't hide it. royale pass is just a way for no skill and just annoying your opponent. and the skill gap is just never there. I'm either going up against someone who just keeps spamming mega-knight or someone with only level 14 cards in arena 7. You rely on money so you can just bribe more people
Monster •_•,1,2025-09-18 01:53:57,"Please improve your merge deck mode. Remove those unnecessary and annoying battle perks ( fewer troops more atk spd ) , The troop pool is the most useless, cannot make the team we want,we have to play the team which has no coordination, Doesn't provide troop when its about to be 3 star. Troop pool becomes empty before i can make my 3 star. everytime gives useless troops and higher cost troop when i am low in elixir . Its an unbalanced game mode where luck is the required skill. make bench big 2."
László Zeimen,1,2025-09-19 19:02:00,"bad experience, p2w players are ruining the game, maybe something that would help keep the game and fun alive is make the matchmaking level based, because currently my lvl 12 deck isnt good enough to beat lvl 15 evo mega knight and pekka decks, mixed with other atleast lvl 14 cards. Please stop eating money and focus on fun and actually making the game based on skill, not money."
Conner,1,2025-10-10 21:02:34,why is it that when I am almost about to go to the next arena that I play pay to win players??? You should make it fair between who plays who. this is crazy also how fast the elixir pumps is way to slow... it's feels like my opponent has infinite elixir while I have barely enough to spawn archers... please fix this.
Thomas wheeler,4,2025-08-21 21:13:39,"Good game WHEN 2V2 IS AVAILABLE. HOWEVER, Lucky drops take way too long to open for mediocre rewards, removing chests, banner&season store, keys, etc is insane... and fix clan wars before anything else. Add something to spend gold on after troops are maxed, maybe gift gems when gold storage is full like CoC."
Jens Lee,1,2025-10-07 13:36:08,this is is not good for u bcs it is pay to win and literally everyone is paying. this game is all AI u r not even playing with real human and all it does is making u lose like ten in a row and make u pay to win it and It basically control the outcome of the round. For example if the game wants u to lose It will give the AI like more exifer and just keep spamming u with the best cards ever.
Glen Selimaj,4,2025-10-12 14:54:29,"The game itself is very good, cool concept and overall its good gameplay, But theres a problem with people that p2w all the time, im only at 1.8k trophies and im seeing way too many opponents that have evolutions, Id really like for the game to lower the pay items in the game"
Kiseki Shimizu,3,2025-09-03 21:48:48,"back to three stars, this game used to be so great, everything was fine, sure maybe a bit of raging, but now I can't find entertainment, all the rounds I'm playing are usually against people who pay to win, and that's all the ""skill"" they need, they can spam any card they want already at lvl 15 when I'm barely lvl 10, please just make this more balanced, don't throw the community away with cheat p2w tactics"
Jeff Fritz,1,2025-10-10 07:09:12,I stopped playing in 2022 because of pay to win. decided to give this game another chance after of few years. enjoyed it until I started running into to pay to win wall again with the level 15 and evolution cards. absolute joke of an update making it even more pay to win. another money grab from Supercell. they should be embarrassed.
Alexis Garza,5,2025-10-24 11:05:47,I've played clash royals for a week and the first 2 days i pushed 2k trophies straight then it got way harder and i got to arena 12. Overall still very fun and very strategic. I really like how they give legendary cards technically for FREE like i have inferno dragon with the purple gem thing and royal ghost now!! I used to grind on brawl stars which i quit now because i have over 23k trophies and i feel like this is a way fun game especially because of how much strategy i need to actually win.
Michael Legoffe,1,2025-09-23 06:51:35,"This game is pay to win garbage made popular by jynxzi. early on it was fun but now they have made the most blatant unacceptable pay advantage in any game I have EVER played. If u get to a competitive arena u will only face people with card 2-3 levels higher than u and it takes MONTHS to level up ONE card without money. Until u hit the absolute top ladder, spending more than your opponent will always gift u the win and its awful as a free to play player. Basically ignore the trend this game suck"
COUNTING numbers,1,2025-11-03 18:06:37,"in the game, this game used to be fun and had to use skills. Nowdays, most players will just spend moneh on the game to get the newest cards or evo which makes free2play players unwinable. At least make it so that free2play players ca also get the newer evos easier."
B,2,2025-11-01 23:25:28,"BUG: When on merge tactics, clicking the i button that is on the merge tactics logo (right of battle button) brings up some ""Welcome to Merge Tactics"" pop-up. On this, it shows Bandit with the OLD TRAITS. No assassin, instead the OLD avenger trait on bandit. FIX YOUR BROKEN GAME SUPERCELL, LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE"
Arash Farshbaf,2,2025-09-25 16:50:12,"Extremely pay to win, oh you win 3 times in a row? Guess what, you're gonna lose 6 times and can't do anything about it. You have some skill? Your enemy has card levels way above you, what you gonna do about that? Clash of Clans is way better than this manipulative game."
Aden,1,2025-09-13 23:41:00,The game used to be great. Played for years. It just feels pay to win anymore. Devs hide behind automated messaging systems and are clearly not interested in feedback to fix this issue. Spare your sanity and your wallet.
Reda Acheache,1,2025-10-07 01:08:21,Ever since one of the latest updates I haven't been able to play the game. Game starts loading and then turns itself off. I have contacted support but apart from the generic answers they have not come up with a solution.
Chad Nelson,1,2025-09-21 19:41:45,Cheating is becoming way to common... I used to believe there wasn't much cheating on a mobile game until recently watching people spawn 5 and 7 elixir cards back to back with not breaking and just covering the field. The game has lost any sort of enjoyment.
Kyriakos Korianitis,4,2025-09-29 20:21:49,"This game has gone to he*l. This has to be the worst supercell game ever. This last update was not for loser's it was was for those who love spending money on the game and gave them another reason to do so. Clash royale dev team,FIX YOUR GAME!!!!! Edit: So I started playing again, and I'm having a lot of fun. Now, it's not what it used to be but it's a lot better than when I quit."
Carson McDonald,4,2025-09-30 04:00:48,"This game is very fun and entertaining however very pay to win, I am not paying a single dollar on this game and I am progressing decently, if you pay it is easier but if you don't you need lots of persistence and time."
David Oakill,1,2025-09-27 03:49:28,"broken game. unbalanced and poorly executed. updated to add the amount of hacking and cheating is unrivaled in any game I've ever played. should be removed from all mobile stores until it can be fixed. hacking is also out of control, wouldn't trust spending money on this."
Jenson Griffiths,3,2025-08-31 15:59:28,"a genuinely solid experience. the combat is solid, the animations and designs are good. I wouldnt call it groundbreaking, but hey, its a solid time if you've got a decent WiFi connection"
Dinenrbone,2,2025-09-29 22:49:38,"the game is enjoyable, but with more evos and cards getting released the less possible it becomes for many f2p to really go outside of one deck, or even edit it without bein under-leveled, but if you can go through that it can still be quiet enjoyable."
Guerilla War4s,1,2025-08-29 12:33:50,i can see my team dropping their cards but i dont see any play happening nor can i drop my cards. everything fast forwards after 15-20 seconds. its so buggy its not even my internets problem. wasting my time having to wait until i lose or close the game.
A Google user,1,2025-08-15 02:23:21,"pay to win and rigged games, until I finally manage to get ahead of the counter deck the bot has i lose connection, mind you im next to my router and NEVER had any problems in this area. I believe the motive behind forcing the player to lose is to make them feel like they can't win unless they pay for more stuff, and I am disappointed with what used to be one of my favorite games has become, it's an empty greedy shell of what is used to be, supercell please be better."
Caleb Chu,5,2025-09-27 04:21:16,"I love this game, its highly addictive. I just feel like CR is matching me with hard counters and p2w players like 70% of the time, but this game is good overall mainly because the CR team keeps the game active fun exiting and surprising. I asked for an in-game chat and they responded in less than two days. GREAT game and great support team."
Evan Yonan,5,2025-08-17 08:36:01,This game is really fun would want everyone to play it. I recently installed it a few months ago and this is really fun. It can be tricky at the start and a bit confusing but eventually you will be able to understand the game and enjoy it! Keep it up Clash Royale
jennifer putman,4,2025-09-29 20:28:48,"I've been playing for few years and its changed a lot from when I began. most of my cards are maxed out, I do not pay to play. join a clan, if you can get dash pass will help you increase lvl and card lvls but if not just take ur time. eventually you'll get there. its z game for fun and just like any game there are ppl who pay to play. there are nice ppl toxic ppl. but again its a game if its not fun for you, find one that is..."
ian s,1,2025-10-04 13:38:22,"It used to be fun. Supercell has always been greedy, but they've taken it way too far. Probably the most pay to win competitive game ever made. A good online multi-player game is supposed to be fair. This game couldn't be further from fair."
Logan Cole,1,2025-09-27 00:56:30,It's a fun game but it's entirely pay to win. If you actually plan to be competitive (which is the standard gamemode) then you would have to spend hundreds of dollars just to have a shot.
Hermes,3,2025-10-11 22:37:58,This is one of the best games ever made but I really despise having to tap a bunch of times to open a chest. It doesn't create the reward system that I think it is supposed to create. Please make it an option to remove that!!
drake kielborn,5,2025-10-14 22:45:47,I love this game I played a few years ago and just got back into it is annoying when you get matched with people of way higher card levels than you but I guess that's how matchmaking works. I do wish there were evos in stuff like mega draft or triple draft for private battles because the regular mode isn't worth progressing unless your trying to flex.
Alligator Games,1,2025-08-28 17:22:37,"I'll give Clash Royale 1 star until there is a creative and entertaining update to have fun with. I quit for now. 28/08/25 // Clan Wars Update? Season Shop? Chests? Star levels? Absurdly unbalanced gameplay?... So many complaints with no solutions... They keep away from solving the community complaints... I loved this game back in the beginning, but they went in the worst direction... Clash Royale clearly shows what NOT to do in a video game that already worked."
Rio Watson Tan,2,2025-09-26 20:26:43,this game was filled to p2w players and all you could do to get past certain points was to pay to win. this game is filled of ways to buy your way to the top and skip a lot of progress.
Cameron Kruse,1,2025-09-07 08:31:19,"the game is fun until it becomes rigged, the matchmaking system puts me up against a robot with a deck that is meant to completely counter mine, even if the cards it uses aren't able to be obtained in my arena. I am locked in arena 7-8 because it keeps putting me against these robots, how no one has said anything about the robot is insane."
Arik Ahmed,1,2025-09-30 03:27:44,"They are trying to kill the game with this new updates. Now you get half of the rewards you used to get before the new update. Old problems such as Bad matchmaking, super hard and time consuming to upgrade cards, still remain."
Jac Pritchard,1,2025-08-30 01:58:40,"I'm at 9k and clash royale has quite literally ruined my future, hopes, dreams and respect. U may not believe a single, harmless game can do this permanent damage to a person but TRUST ME, IT DOES! I hate this game so much but it's so addictive that I cannot come to agreement with myself to actually uninstall this TERRIBLE game. Thanks clash for bringing this pain upon me..."
sal sar,1,2025-09-21 13:30:27,"Clash Royale was once a skill-based game where strategy and timing determined victory. Today, matches often hinge on who has access to overpowered cards rather than tactical prowess. The competitive scene, once vibrant and respected, has become a shadow of its former self. Evolutions and tower troops overshadow strategic gameplay, turning matches into races to out-cycle broken mechanics"
Abdias Moreno,4,2025-08-26 09:29:31,People say it's pay to win. Not true. I'm at 10000 trophies(which means I beat the game) played since the beginning of last year. I've never paid a cent and yet I've got 17 evos. I grind If u don't it'll take longer to get higher. But it's certainly possible. Everyone who's frustrated has skill issue. 4 stars because it's just not perfect. Occasional bugs and bad balance changes. They do ask crazy amounts for new op cards only to nerf them. Besides that it's awesome
piefee,1,2025-09-03 06:58:18,I've been playing for years and I actually hate war matchmaking and when they have level 13+ cards when I'm level 11 is why I'm not going to be playing anymore and it's way to hard to upgrade high level cards your going to be dumping lots of money to -update game is still hot garbage level 10 cards matching with people with level 13+ cards how is somone supposed to play f2p
Knight Elmer L. Agosto,5,2025-10-22 07:41:31,"Clash Royale is honestly one of the best games out there. It’s fun, strategic, and super addictive. I still get hyped winning close matches or unlocking new cards. The graphics and updates keep it fresh, and it never really gets boring. Easy 5 stars."
Buddo,1,2025-10-18 20:31:47,"I’m a mid-ladder player at around 6,7k trophies, and the game is absolutely unplayable here!!! Admittedly, my cards are underleveled at level 11, but everyone else has level 13–14 cards, and the Mega Knight is a huge problem. YES, I know how to defend him, but try defending a level 14 Mega Knight with level 11 cards. And you literally face him every second match! 95% of players have been screaming for a nerf for 7 years, but Supercell doesn’t care about anyone who isn’t a pro!"
Gavyn Thomas-McCown,4,2025-10-18 01:32:02,"fun, easy for everyone, and not a lot of glitches. the only problem was you kinda have to buy things to win in the high league. so it was a five-star, but I don't want to spend money."
JAYDEN WAIT,5,2025-10-25 18:44:33,This game is one of the best games i have ever gotten into. Ive been playing for a couple seasons now and i think the game is kinda pay to win. As an anrena 13 player i think that you should not unlock the use of p2w becasue were in such low arenas
Vince Norman,1,2025-10-18 05:37:20,"Absolutely terrible game. Way to p2w, and the trophy loss system should be half of what u win. Takes forever to get any new cards and half of your opponents have overfeed cards from micro transactions. I wouldn't recommend to even try it."
Joseph,3,2025-10-24 11:45:40,"I like the way chests work, but the monetization is horrendous. All over the place the game advertizes ""free"" things that are not free, they cost money. THATS NOT FREE."
Matt Abel,1,2025-11-03 23:36:15,"This game used to be fun and had a lot of potential, but at this point it's only fun until you get to level 13-14. After that, you will meet the pay to win kids with their dad's credit card. They own everything, every Evo, every card is 15, and the wall to get from 14 to 15 is pay to win itself. If you spend zero dollars on this game, I can guarantee you that you'll never own every Evo, and you'll never get every card to 15. It is objectively impossible to do. You will hate it or spend $$$$$$$$$"
Austin Bidlen,1,2025-10-25 04:03:24,"why make a game when even the devs admit to it being pay to win if you don't have money to spend on this game your not getting anywhere people having cards and evos they shouldnt have or Smurfers who get rlly high in the game and then restart cuc ""it's not fun anymore"" my opinion take out everything that cost real money and make where you have to earn your cars like how it was"
Ossiel Flores,5,2025-10-21 02:51:04,Incredibly fun and adictive! The quick strategic 1v1 battles are perffect for mobile gaming. Great blend of cards collecting and real-time action. Always feel rewarding to win. A must download!!
Antonio D,5,2025-11-03 22:40:46,"Always fun, it is kind of ilke star wars chess!!!! after the recent update they stripped the merge tactics section of mine! im so upset. i re-download the game to play that mode."
nick christakis,1,2025-10-23 06:58:59,Ive had my account since 2016. Nd i gotta say this is awful now. really just a cashgrab. ive never seen a game so dependent on spending money. i remember when this game too some form of strategy. now yu jus get bullied if yu dont spend money. yu cant compete unless yu have money to spend or make this game yur entire life.
James,4,2025-10-28 19:31:07,Good game as long as you realise that you are not playing in real time against live opponents. It has always been an AI lead game. There really is no need to spend lots of money. Just have fun.
Tamer Duoma,5,2025-10-31 04:53:00,"this game is great! it's easy to understand, very fun, and needs strategic thinking. this game acts as a fresh restart for the people with sharp minds. I honestly think that this is the best mobile game ever"
William Davis,1,2025-10-21 11:07:29,"I hate this game, and the devs, with a passion. However, I've played it for 8 years. At least I've never given them any money. Update: Fix the merge battle system you cucks! Update: 500 characters isn't enough to express my hatred of the devs. I'm praying that their obvious lack of morals drives them to off themselves. Merge battle is 80% luck based, everything else is pay to win. I have everything except evolutions and champions maxed, have 5 mil gold, 9 years in now. How am I not maxed? kys cr"
Kyle Cary,1,2025-10-20 09:14:05,"terrible experience, the game refused to refund me when I was unsatisfied with their misleading purchases and then didnt allow me to participate in an event because I wasnt in a clan when it started. I hope someone mails a bomb to you."
vSnazzy1,1,2025-11-04 17:09:48,i wanna play this game again I wanna give it a 5 Star but I've got 1 problem I've tried everything when I try to log into my level 30 account I put my email in but it never sends the verification code I've checked every folder even spam and nothing gets sent can you plzz help me
Allen,1,2025-10-27 01:46:56,"Jynxzi is the only reason this game is big. It's terrible, the spammers, the hard counters, bm, terrible fan base. Terrible game overall. I could be placing everything down and be countered by a Pekka and two more behind that."
Safyan,1,2025-10-27 01:03:24,terrible recent experience. i have lost so many crowns just because of poor connection issues even though my wifi works fine. i keep having to login again in between games.
ZeltaH,1,2025-10-20 16:07:34,"very good game 5/5 stars, also cant wait for the next maintenance break, its so exciting to wait for a couple of hours every day to play for something as meaningful as a couple of buffs/nerfs even tho literally no other games have this feature! Thats why this game is so unique and i love it!"
Clarence Repoldo,1,2025-10-25 13:55:06,That games challenges are a gem wasting and it destroys you're mental health if you used the top 10 decks for the 20 win challenge and ended up losing more than winning and clash royale is the worst pay to win game with so much updates that made people angry and hated it in my opinion. Man what is wrong with supercell
Sara Cova,5,2025-10-29 08:59:57,"I really don't care if it is pay to win or no, but after the new update the game lost so much, there's no longer any incentive to play, no rewards after fights, no season shop, no chests, no daily tasks. It just sucks"
Piotr W,1,2025-10-24 00:00:49,"The game is extremely p2w to the point where if you don't pay you have no chance of winning, terrible balance (especially evolutions), bots 90% of games instead of real players, also bots are perfect counter to your deck so you cant win most of the time, bots have rigged elixir numbers, also the toxicity im this game is insane but that's a community issue"
Dusan Simonovic,1,2025-10-18 00:32:16,so this game was great for past 9 years there weren't pay to win things and yall updating game and putting pay to win things like champions in shop where everyone can buy them even tho if your in lower or higher arena I enjoyed this game when I start playing it but then yall add ptw things and I quit
Chan Kian leng,1,2025-10-20 14:44:22,"app server super lad very slow always hang..other app all working not my problems please fix it, getting worst now even cannot log in. you treat people saying out problems in this game rather than fix the problem, kids managing this apps??never send me code for verification what's this"
MaHaN gh,2,2025-10-21 21:26:25,"If you havent play this in more than 2 years, you basically cant beat players who buy play pass monthly. Its unbelievable that they somehow managed to make this a pay to win game!"
Britt Cornelissens,1,2025-11-04 17:18:20,after last update i cannot play anymore. i start a match and then it closes the app immediately. Tried clearing cache and deleting and downloading again. nothing works
Desirae McCloskey,4,2025-10-22 02:04:04,I love the game because of the way you have to play but pay to win is horrible i wished there would be a different mode for payy to win players. Multiple times i play i get boss bandit in arena 4 like how am i supposed to defend that.
mizu,1,2025-11-03 20:56:12,"I played this game for a long time as F2P, the progression was slow, but doable if you focused on only one deck (almost maxed mine). This update they removed all EWC from ladder and ranked, making it basically impossible to even max out 1 deck..."
Kayleigh,1,2025-10-20 21:23:36,it logged me out of my account and won't let me back in because of the update I have spent money on 2 pass royales and was on dragon spar please fiz this the update is finished and I can't get in because it is my broken phones email and I can't do my verification please let me get back in I have 7031 trophies
Matthew Cleave,1,2025-10-31 01:37:00,"rubbish game, all it does is match you with hard counter decks or overleveled people, it's a horrible experience and it's a waste of time. another thing is how mean people is, people practically say go cry and the game is a cashgrab..."
Wan23,1,2025-10-22 10:09:56,"good job supercell whatever update you pushed. now i could not retrieve my progress. game was reset and whenever i retrieve pin from my email, it is not accepted. time to say good bye after decade of playing this game"
Mia O'Brian,5,2025-10-23 06:04:16,"this is the most unfair and horrible garbage game I've ever played in my life, I have done horrors which shall never be named cause it would make me seen as an animal rather than a human, things that even the strongest of people and the bravest of souls would gag, feeling a burning sensation in their throats at the pure terror it takes to take in the horrific acts that took place because of this game. 10/10 would recommend"
Brian W,1,2025-10-30 02:58:53,"my account that was 7 years old is permanently locked because I didn't set up a supercell ID. I can't get in touch with a human at customer support, and I have been given the run around by a chat bot for over 24 hours. I wish I could steal from these people like they have stolen from me."
A#N#I#M#E KING,1,2025-10-29 12:58:43,i hate this game it always faces you to a pay to win whenever I am about to reach next arena all of my cards are level 12 and I am facing of against lvl 14-15 guys .this game just sucks i hate this game nd i will not recommend you to play this game if you dont want to lose braincells. ima about to go to every other games made by supercell and say this same thing and give the same rating .i would have given this a 0 star game if it was possible.😡😡😡 dont test my patience literally hate this👎
Shahnoor Omer,2,2025-10-19 21:46:34,the game has a huge pay to win problem. For people playing this game without using money will be incredibly hard. Especially if you are a more casual player
Mohammad Aslani,5,2025-11-04 01:25:26,I love this game but after the lasted updated there's a problem for me that when I start the merge tactic mode the game crash while the war is going on and after I open the game again it still running the war but in a second it crash again until it's over
Athithan L,1,2025-10-22 20:35:13,"Constant network reconnecting in merge tactics make the game play frustrating. It's been there for months since its launch, yet no solution!"
Petar Visic,5,2025-10-20 15:50:34,Is a great game for people who play every day like me and it has great adventure through the arenas that include many varieties of card. What is cool is their are clan wars and ther is evolutions that can enhance gameplay and fun.
Cristian Radulescu,4,2025-10-19 17:09:26,"I've been playing this game for years. It has become so cluttered, there are pay to upgrade traps all over the place. Balance for opponents seems good."
Adarsh Kumar,4,2025-10-26 16:56:13,game is awesome and very engaging but the annoying thing is that when we switch outside the game it was restarted from the starting doing all the stuff of loading and upgrading
Nathan,2,2025-10-21 14:16:24,You lost my progress. when i try to get my account back. It didn't send a code so I couldn't get my progress. I have level 7 mini pekka which was overpowered and you lost it and my deck including witch (my favourite)
Alex Persaud,2,2025-10-25 03:00:40,It astonishes me every time I open this game that Supercell literally refuses to properly balance their BEST GAME. Don't play any game made by Supercell. it's more waste of storage and time on ur phone then actual fun.
Peter Z,5,2025-10-27 21:51:30,"I've been playing your game since you released it. I have been playing merge tactics since it's first season as well and I've made it over 3000 in both of its first seasons and the first season was mostly well balanced. I understand you cant account for everything on a first run but this second season into the third, there is one best team and if you get it, you just win. Valk, knight, golden knight, goblin, dart goblin, and archer. The synergies are just the best. The rest are not cost effectiv"
Akshay kumar,1,2025-10-30 23:00:57,My Clash Royale account got hacked today. The hacker changed the email and took full control of the account. I’ve been playing for 4 years without any issues and have always been fair player... please help soon as possible...
Tiaan,4,2025-10-20 15:24:39,"""absolutely a wonderfull game ... great time spender ... well done supercell"" this is the review i left in 2017 after i started playing, 9 years later at 13.5k trophies, i can confirm, welldone SUPERCELL💪"
Lily Davies,2,2025-10-21 13:17:28,this game was pretty fun but then I realise they take away your wins for not winning?! this is totally unfair to other who can't play well and have alot of wins and all their wins which they worked hard for gets stolen they should fix this honestly I'm sick of it!
Dylan Cornell,3,2025-10-22 10:09:51,"I cannot put into words just how pay to win and unbalanced this game is, the developers absolutely hate their community and the balance of the game but besides that the game can be pretty fun. SUPERCELL FIX YOUR GAME"
amirreza,5,2025-11-04 01:49:43,"best game , and merge tactics are the BEST MODE EVER, I'm writing my feedback after more than 9 or 10 years and recently it's not showing merge tactics for me please fix this issue with a little update and please add this feature as a main Mode forever"
Michael Kaiser,3,2025-10-17 21:27:04,I'd like to be able to edit my boat battle decks while on cool down for the day. Oct 2025 - Bugs preventing war attacks by my clan. It's hard enough to get them to log in. Your deployment QA process is broken.
